1 Boundaries of the language- One of the most important factors that h
contributed to the cultural unity of Gujarat 1s its language, called the Guyar
language which 1s the spoken language all over Gujarat The linguistic bounda
however, of the Gujarat: language are more extensive than the political ones of Gujar
In Cutch, Gujarati 1s the court-languag$ and the language of education and cultu
there it 1s steadily superceding the vernacular, Cutchi, which is a branch of Sin
In Sind, it has penetrated as far as Mitthi, about 30 miles due north beyond t
great desert of Cutch Here it mixes with Sidi with which, linguistically speaki
it is not very closely related From Matth, the boundary line runs almost in
straight line due east and reaches the B B andC I Railway lne at Shree Amirga
a taluka town of Palanpur State and a few miles south of Abu Road All along t
ne xt comes in contact with Marwan, a language closely allied to Gujarati and wi
its dialects spoken in Sirohi and Danta, and imperceptibly merges with these for
of speech From Shree Amirgadh, the boundary goes north-east beyond M
kantha and Idar, and then turns south-east reaching Dahod, including within t
Gujarati-speaking area, the State of Lunawada, and Jalod. From Dahod the li:
goes south shghtly inclined to the west bringing within the Gujarati area the Stat
of Chota Udepur and Rajprpla Throughout this boundary, z¢, from Shree Ami
gadh to a few mules south of Raypipla State, the Gujarati comes in contact, a
gradually and imperceptibly merges into the various Bhili dialects From Raypipl
the line goes south beyond the whole of Surat district and the forests of Dang
Here it meets Khandesi, a dialect of the Western group to which Gujarati al
belongs. With Khandeshi, Gujarati merges imperceptibly The line then ru
straight to the west for about 35 miles reaching the Arabian Sea at Umargaon, a fe
miles south of Daman Here Gujarati comes m contact with Marathi in the e
and makes a mixture of dialects in that area, and towards the sea, it mixes wit
Konkan with which Gujarati 1s more alhed.

The above boundary is more or less the same as the traditional one given b
Sir George Grierson and others But modern research and further imvestigatio
lead us to adopt a few modifications therem, which are bnefly stated here Whe
one actually visits these places on the Borderline, he 1s struck by the arbitrarine
with which Bhih dialects and the dialects of Khandesh are separated from Gujarat
‘The change from Gujarati to Bhili and, towards the south, to Khandeshi is so impe
ceptible that an expenenced Imguist would hesitate to partition the homogeneo
speech into two different languages The fact about these dialects seems to be th
ithey are predominantly Gujarati in thé west, and slowly and slowly tend to becom

tions of the culture of Gujarat where traditions of the Gujarati language are main-
tained, cultivated and inculcated to children Of all these Bombyy 15 so powerful
that it often sets its standards which serve as models for Gujarat proper

There are besides, some wondering tribes in the Punjab, Kashmerc, Rajputana,
etc, which speak dialects which have closer affimty with Guyarati than with any
other language of India They are, therefore, considered as the dialects of Guarati:

2 The Position of Gujarat i the Scheme of Indo-European Languages —Gujar
like Hindi, Punjabi and other sister-dialects of modern India, 1s derived from t
Old Indian language, also called the Indo-Aryan, the oldest hterary form of whi
is recorded m the Rgveda This Old Indian 1s a sister-language of the Old Iran
recorded later on im its literary form m the Gathic parts of Avesta and im some
Persian Inscriptions The Old Indian and the Old Iraman together with a few.
dialects of Mesopotama and Asia Mmor, called Mittam, Manda, Kassites, etc , m
of which are now dead, complete the Aryan group Much mformation is not
available about these dialects, but what little 1s known about them enables us
locate their position in the classification of the languages of the Aryan bran
This Aryan branch 1s one of the branches into which the Indo-European langu
split up im pre-historic times Besides the Aryan branch, the Indo-European
the Greek, the Italo-Keltic, the Germanic, the Slavo-Baltic, the Albaman and
Armenian branches with many sub-branches for each which have now spread o
a large part of the civilised world Jn order, therefore, to understand the pro
place which Gujarati occupies in the scheme of the Indo-European languages, 1
necessary to have a. look into its short history and to see how, after passing thro
the various stages in 1ts development nght from the Indo-European, it came
assume its present form

3 Results of Comparative Method Applied to the I E Languages .—It must
stated at the outset that there 1s not as yet discovered a single word written im the I
Janguage Phulologists have toiled for three generations to arrive at certain results
comparing the various Old and Conservative languages hke Sanskrit, Greek, etc , a
have discovered certain linguistic correspondences on the strength of which they
able to ‘reconstruct’ the Old I, E languages The comparisons have revealed so
valuable and relable information not only about the I E, language but also ab
the common habitation and civilization of the I. E people and their journies
‘various parts of the world after them separation from the common habitation

Semantic studies of Indo-European words have yielded additional and umpo
ant mformation about the stages of development m the I E.1tself, and mvestigatio
into 1ts loan-words borrowed from the neighbouring languages, the history of whi
is known to ws, have resulted m providing us with mformation about the differe
cultural contacts m which the I E people came in ther undivided habitation T
study of loan-words in the I.E has also enabled us to arnve at an approxmmate d
when the I E people lived together and when, finally, they parted

Without attemptmg to sketch the various theories about the origmal home
the I. E people, ther approximate tne and the reasons why they finally parted,
will be quite sufficient for the purpose of this short sketch 1f we state below only t
conclusions which have found favour with a majority of I E phulologists

North-West m the Kirghiz Steppes north of the Aral Sea, some time before the mid
of the third millenum BC, the Indo-European people hved together united by
common language and common rehgion and culture Their language consisted of

4 THE LANGUAGE OF GUJARAT

Jarge variety of vowels, vowel diphthongs and consonants with the stop-clement
preponderating over the spirant There were at least four series of stops * the Vorce-
-less stops’ *p,*t, *k,, *k" , the voiced *b, *d, g,, *g™, the aspirated voiced *bh, tdh,
*geh, *g™h; and the aspirated voiceless, which were of rare occurrence *ph,*th,
‘kh and *kYh, Arranged in accordance with their places of articulation, they present
the following series . labials . *p, *b, *ph, *bh ; dentals - *t, *d, *th, *dh ; pre-palatals :
*ky, *gx, *kyh, *gjh, and post-palatals *k”, *g*, *kh, *e™h There was at least
‘one sibilant s which was unvoiced generally, but its voiced vanety existed under
‘ certain combinations. The proper vowels were: *e, *2; *o, *5, *a, *4 There was,
besides, a class of sounds called sonants which played the double role of vowels and
‘consonants mm accordance with the different combinations in which they figured.
Thus : (1) They assumed consonantal roles of *y, *w, *r, 1, *n and *m inutially and
vunder certain other conditions. (2) Coming after the proper vowels they formed
‘diphthongs namely, *e1, *eu, *er, *el, *en, *em, *o1, *ou, *or, *ol, *on, *om, *ai, *au,
ar, *al, Yan, *am, *e1, *d1, *aa, etc (3) In the capacity of vowels they appeared as
+i, *u, *r, *1,*n,*m. (4) They assumed a sort of intervocalic role when a short vowel,
-designated by the symbol *°, developed before them, where they happened to be
followed by the proper vowels Thus they appeared as *°ye, *°we, etc , *°yo, *°wo,
etc, and *°ya, *°wa, etc Besides these phonemes there was a nutral vowel, desig-
nated by the symbol *9

5 The Indo-European Granvmar Described ~The Indo-European word con-~
™>, sisted of 3 elements (a) the root, (6) the suffix or suffixes, and (c) the termmation, all
of which consisted of one or more vowels or consonants or both In the various forms
of the same word, each of the proper vowels *8, +5 or *& occurnng mm roots, suffixes
or terminations was liable to be substituted by the other or to be elammated altogether.
This gave rise to the phenomenon, described by the philologists as the Vowel gradation.

There were two main grades in this system, the ngh (contammg the vowels é or 6)
and the low (containing the vowel a or zero). But occasionally, the low grade dis-
tinguished two sub-grades, the middle (containing the vowel a) and the zero-grade
containing no vowel at all). Combmed with sonants, the grades assumed different
forms like— .

t

High grade. Low grade:

ei or o1 1 ,

eu or ou u

er or or Tr

em or om ™m, also we get the combinations
dhhke the followmg. we or wo u

re or ro r, etc,

There were cases where a sort of gradation in consonant and in sonants was
observed, but they were of rare occurrence Coming to Grammar, the Indo-Euro-
pean words consisted of two Jarge classes (1) The nouns, consisting of substantives,
adjectives, pronouns, numerals, and participles (2) The verbs, chiding the finite
‘verbs and participles There were separate verbal themes for tenses and moods
‘The tense-themes were (a) the present-theme, (5) the Aonst-theme and (c) the perfect-

JOURNAL OF THE GUJARAT RESEARCH SOCIETY F

theme, each of which was arnved at in different ways either by addition of suffixes
and infixes or by reduplication The model themes were made from the temporal
ones by adding a further suffix for each special mood. The terminations were either
primary or secondary and were im many cases different for the Present-Aorist System
on the one hand and for the Perfect-System on the other There were two broad
classes of verbs, the thematic class to which a vowel ike -1 was added before applymg
dhe terminations, and the a-thematic class to which the terminations were added
directly. Tenses denoted time as well as aspects There was, besides, a large class
of denvative verbs, such as the nomial verbs, the passive, the causal, etc., derived
from the pnmitive verbs by adding dificrent suffixes with or without radical modi-
fications The Indo-European verbal system was therefore very intricate Nouns
were arnved at bv a large number of primary and secondary suffixes in which two
main categories of Agent-nouns and Action-nouns were well-marked Terminations
were added to the nominal bases thus arnved at and they denoted 8 case-relations,
including the one-denoted by the vocative, and 3 numbers, including the dual,
There were 3 genders (1) the Masculine, generally representing the male sex in
animale or implying the idea of greatness, vigour and grossness, in inanimate nouns.
(n) The Feminine representing the female sex m animals and implying the idea of
smallness, tenderness, e{c, im inanimate nouns, and (im) the neuter implying no
specific ideas denoted by the Masculine and the Feminine genders The Indo-
Europcan had, moreover, a wonderful way of compounding two or more nouns which
gave brevity to the language. There were also the personal pronouns for 3 persons,
the demonstrative and the mterrogative pronouns Tlus whole class of nouns was
divided into vanous classes or types for each of which there were different ways of
addine the terminations — There was also a pitch-accent which shifted from place to
place in the different forms of a word Coming to vocabulary, there were nouns for
parts of body, famuly relations, animals, trees, objects of culture and faith, and articles
of food There were adjectives for colour, dimensions, shapes, ctc , and there were
numerals at Ieast up to 1,000 There were verbs or roots, of which more than a
hundred have been identified, which denoted vanous actions and activities.

G Dialects in the Indo-European In its earher form, the Indo-European.
had no dialects, but later on tendencies for dialectical variations came into exstence
which were ultimately responsible for the mse of well-marked dialects Some phi-
lologists prefer to call the earlier form of the Indo-European as the Primitive Indo-
European and distinguish it from the later and better known form called merely the
Indo-European A few isoglossal lines for the dialectical tendencies noted above
are as follows :—

(:) The treatment of Gutterals or Post-palatals The onental group consist-
ing of Indo-Iramian, the Slav, the Baltic, the Armenian and the Albanion
languages change the IE *k¥ to a sibilant: type, satem; whereas the
western group consisting of the Greek, the Italic, the Keltic and the
Germanic languages change it to k . type, centum. This change is known
as the famous,satem-centum change This differentiation proves that

“ in’the IE there were two modes of pronouncmg the labio-palatal or as
‘ they are often called, the post-palatal stops

wn

§ THE LANGUAGE OF GUJARAT

(1) The treatment of If *6: The Indo-Iraman, the Slav, the Baltic the

Albaman and the Germanic languages confounded JE *5 with IE *2;
but the Armenian, the Greek, the Italic, the Keltic distmguished them.
Thus, 1 1s clear that in IE, the eastern group pronounced the vowel *6 in
a more backward and downward position then did the western group

(17) The augment existed m Indo-Iranian, Armenian and Greek Janguages,
but not in others

It 1s interesting to see, in this connection, that the 1soglossal Imes do not exactly
comside with one another These tendencies developed more and more prominent-
ly and led, later on, to the differentiation of dialects in the IE —Some wniters try to
prove that m the Pnmutive IE stage, there were a few more phonemes such as the
glottal stop, some voiced spirants, a stress accent, etc , but these conjectures are
extremely hazardous.—It was during this IV, penod that the ITE people come m
contact with the more civilized Summenans from whom they borrowed some words
and culturalideas The IE word for ‘the cow’ wiz *g"ous for example is proved
to be a loan from the Summenans This was somewhere about 2700 BC

7. The Splat wn the Indo-European and the three stages of Development The
first to get away from the common TE habitation were the ancestors of the Hittites.
‘They came to Asia Minor and raised a kmgdom there They were not perhaps nu-
merous enough to impose their language upon the pre-Hittite non-IE people whom
they subjugated im Asia Minor, and were ultimately absorbed in them The next
party to secede somewhere before 2000 BC was a very large group of the Aryans.
They followed the same path over which thei earher brethren had gone, but they
proceeded further east and established kingdoms of Mittam, Manda, Harm and
Kassrtes m Asia Minor and North-West Mesopotamia Later on in about 1400 BC.
they came in conflict with the Hittites and had to sue for peace In the tablets,
recording the terms of peace, which are recently discovered by Pof De Morgan as
Boghazken:, there occur names of gods found n Reveda im the forms of Indra, Mitra,
Nasatya (Ashvins), written m Babyloman syllabic wnting. This 1s the first and the
earhest record in writmg, of the IE people It is true that the undivided TEs did
not know the art of writmg , otherwise they must have left some written document
in some form or shape. Perhaps the IE people were not then so highly cultured.
But when they came into cultural contacts later on with their more civilised neigh-
bours, particularly with the Babylomans and the Summerians, they learnt from them
the art of wnting Some of these Aryans settled in Asia Minor and Mesopotamia,
while a large number of them left the place and entered Iran

Before entermg Iran and durmg the time when they were leading a more or less
settled hfe in Asia Mimor and Mesopotamia, they had already laid the foundation of
a civikzation which was, later on, called theIndo-Iraman crvihzation and from which
branched off the Indo-Aryan civilization culmmating m India m the form represented
in the Rgveda. The discovery of the Hittite tabletsis one of the most epoch-making
events in this connection, but the material obtained thereby, 1s so small and attended
with so many difficulties about its discipherment that 1t has not yet become possible

to settle finally the relation of the Hittite with (he TE on the one hand and with the
Indo-Iraman on the other After their arrival into Iran, the Aryans created a lite-
rature which has survived in a later form im Avesta, Old Persian and also to a certain
extent im the Old Indian The earhest beginnings of the Vedic literature, not neces-
sanly in the form im which it 15 found in our present Reveda, must have been made in
Asia Minor and the pnoutive Vedie Pantheon must have already come into exrstence
when the Aryans were stilin) Asia Minor, for otherwise the occurrence of the names
of the Vedic Gods in pre-Indo-Traman spelhng remains unexplained Some hymns
probably existed m old forms, which are cither lost or are modermzed by generations
of oral reciters Mention of some very ancient tribes in the Reveda also supports this
Ine of argument) We shall, therefore, bcheve that the language of the Aryans in Asia
Minor, Mesopotanmna and Iran was the one representing the second stage (called the
Indo-Iraman stage) the beginning of which was made in Asia Minor, the first stage was
naturally the same as the last TZ stagawhich the Aryans as TE people, brought with
them after the TE spt The Aryan language in \sia Minor and Mesopotamia was
only an ojd form of the Indo-Iranian proper, probably not diftermg from it in many
respects Thus 2000 BC to 1500 BC, night represent the Indo-Iranian stage.
Finally, when the Arvans entered India somewhere about 1500 BC, they brought
with them the language dev loping mto the Third stage, similar to the language of
the Rgseda This third stage may be called the Indo-Aryan or the Old Indian It
1s from this OF that all the Middle Indian and Modern Indian languages and dialects
belonging to the Aryan family, are ultimately deri ed

So Tite Jndo-Tranan stage When a language develops, it employs 3  pro-
cesses (1) It consurvcs a large part of the old stock, (11) It discards some elements
from the old stock , and (s11) it creates some new forms of expression. The Indo-
Traman discarded the followme old features (a) Short IE vowels, 4, ¢, 6 were sim-
plified into %, and the long i, &, and 6 were simphfied into i — (b) The above change
reduced the number of diphthongs to only six, au, ar, al, am, an (c) The IE
vowel 3 became = (d) The consonants k*, k*h, g*, g*h developed a palatal ten-
dency of pronunciation before palatal vowels ce and1 This gave rise to the famous
palatal lawn of the OI (c) The pre-palatals, k, kh, ete, developed into spirants

voiced and unvoiced, Sand z (f) the dentals became s under the influence of 3, u,
randk It was during this stage, that the foundation of the Vedic Literature that
we now possess, was laid on a large scale ~The gods Mitra, Varuna, Nasatyd, Sirya
and others had come into existence carher, as noted above, in Asia Minor and Meso-
potamia, but the hymns composed at that time in praise of these gods are mostly
Jost and have in some cases changed their old linguistic form by oral tradition and
assumed the form that we find nthe Rgveda It was here, 2 ¢., m Iran, that the
Aryans came in touch with the Asuras and must have held many friendly and hostile
relations with them They must have borrowed words from the non-Indo-European
tribes of Asia -Minor, Mesopotamia and Persia, some of whom were Summenians,
-Akkedians, etc , mentioned above The words for ‘copper,’ ‘axe,’ in Indo-Iranian
are instances Of this kmd The acquisition of the art of writing by the Aryans
from the non-Aryans has already been mentioned .

'9. The Aryan Settlements in India; In about 1500 B.C a spht came once
again in Persia between the Deva-worshippers and the Asura-worshippers, and the
former left the place for India Their journey and entrance were slow and gradual,
the change of the country was imperceptible especially because they travelled with
their families, cattle, etc , and m large numbers, The fauna and flora do not change
so suddenly while passing from Iran to India as to remind one of the entrance into a
new country This is probably the reason why we do not get a direct reference in
the Rgveda to the migration or to the entrance into a new country. In India they
first settled in N -W.F, provinces andthe Punjab The Reveda as we have it today’
was compiled in its final form im this part of the country The Aryans must have
come to India in many groups and at different intervals, as 1s attested by the exist-
ence of dialectical forms of words inthe Rgveda As this stage of the language, viz ,
the OI stage 1s of utmost smportance from the pot of view of the development of the
great modern Indian languages including Guyarati, it is desirable that a more detailed
account of 1t should be given

10 Innovations a the OT The OI differed from the Ilr in the following
respects * (2) The Ilr vocalic groups a1 and au were contracted into e and o, an iii
and 4u shortened into ai and au, (6) the palatalized gutterals were changed to pala-
tals, thus a new series of sounds called the palatals in OI came into existance , (c) the
voiced spirants z and % were lost , (¢) an entirely new series of cerebral sounds, called
the mtirdhanyas by the local grammanans, came into existance , (ec) many grammatical
vforms and analogical mmnovations were introduced, eg, the 2nd future tense, the
penphrastic perfect tense, etc But mspite of these and other changes, the two lan-
guages, the Old Vedic and the Old Avestic still present so much resemblance that
with the help of a few phonetic rules one can easily convert Gatha passages into the
Old Vedic and vice versa

forms or from the meaning The Nouns also distinguish 3 numbers, the singular, the
dual and the plural, and § cases, the Nominative, the Accusative, the Instrumental,
the Dative, the Ablative, the Gemtive, the Locative and the Vocative The noun-
stems are arnved at by applying certain suffixes of which those forming the agent.
nouns and the action-nouns are outstanding The noun-stems end in consonants
and vowcls The stems ending in consonants are changeable or unchangeable when
case-terminations are apphed to them This class of nouns particularly the one
which contains some radical stems 1s very old and has steadily diminished in number
and importance during the dev elopment of the Pr Ol into the later OL The nouns
ending m voxels group themseh es into 5 types + (2) those ending in a or 4, (5) those
in -land -u, (c) thoce iniand i, (@) those in ;,, and (c) those in -c, a1, au Case-
terminations added to these stems take'strong and weak forms for the ‘specific types,
while the stem also assumes two or three forms before some terminations in certain
ty pes, under the influence of the shift of accent and the consequent vowel gradation
The vowdl-ending stems and particularly those ending in a, fi and 17 become so pre-
donunant im later phases of the OI that they practically displace many other types
The adjectives have two wavs of forming comparison, by adding special suffices,
-ivas, Istha and -tara, -tama of which the latter pair is more recent There are car-
dinal and ordinal numerals and also a Jarge number of numeral dervatives In
pronouns, there are personal pronouns of 3 persons, the 3rd distinguishing 3 genders,
and also the Demonstrative, Interrogatie, the Relative, the Reflexive, the Possessive
and the Indefimte Pronouns There are pronountial compounds and derivatives.
Pronouns and Adjectives distinguish gender, number and cases like substantives

Coming to the verbs, there are two voices, the active and the mddle, some roots
are conjugated m one only, while some are conjugated in both There are the fol-
lowing tenses the Present, the Perfect, the Aorist, the two Futures, the Imperfect and
the Conditional These tenses show time as well as aspect Besides the Ind:catzve,
there are the Imperative, the Potential, the Subjuactive and the Iagunctive (or the
Precatwve) moods Tenses are obtained from temporal stems of the roots and moods
are obtained from the modal stems, these latter are obtained by suffixing a modat
suffixes on the top of the temporalstems The temporal stems are three, the Preseut,
the Aorist and the Perfect The Present stem is by far the most umportant of all, as
more than all the verbal forms obtained from the other two stems put together are
obtained from the present stem alone It 1s used for the present-system which in-
cludes the Present and the Imperfect tenses and the Imperative, the Subjunctive, the
Potential and the Ingunctive moods It 1s also useful for the formation of the first
future with an additional suffix and for the present and passive participles Besides
the verbs of the secondary conjugation im-a-, such as the Des:deraitves, the Intensives,
Cousairves, the Denonunatives, etc , take the jirst Conjugation of the Present stem
In the primary conjugation of the present, the stem for the first conjugation is
obtained by adding -a-, -ya-, and -a- to the Ist, 4th and 6th classes of the rdots,
That for the second conjugation is obtained in various ways

10 THE LANGUAGE OF GUJARAT

}

The second conjugation is characterised by the vowel-gradation and the shift
of accent It consists of the roots of the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, Sth and 9th classes,
Terminations are added directly in this conjugation to the final of the root or to the
graded suffixes with stems changing in accordance as the terminations are strong or.

“weak In the roots of the 2nd class the termumations are added directly , im the 3rd
the root takes reduphcation and to the reduphicated root the termmations are added
directly , in the 5th and the Sth -nu- and -u- are added between the root and the ter-
munations ; in the 9th, na- 1s sumlarly added , while in the 7th class na- or -n- is
infixed m the body of the root, and the terminations are added directly to the final
of the root An augment a- 1s prefixed to the verbal forms to obtain the Imperfect
from the present and conditional from the future

The perfect stem 1s obtained by various types of reduphcation of the root and is
useful for the perfect system The reduplicated form of the root 1s also used for
conjugatmg the 3rd class of roots in the presemt system as noted above, and for getting
the Desiderative, the Intensive and one vanety of the Aonst The OI Aorzst 1s augs
mented, it takes the secondary termmations and has moods and participles The
Aorist stem 1s obtamed in various ways The one for the sigmatic variety 1s formed
by mnsertmg -s- with or without an added -a- between the root and the ending That
for the second aonst consists of the mere root or the root plus a connecting -a- added
to the simple or to the specially reduphicated, root. There are 4 forms of the first

‘, aomst and 3 of the second The aorist stem also yields the Benedzctzve and the Pre-
cative which latter is 1ts optative form obtamed by adding -s- after the modal suffix
The modal forms of the aonst are not numerous There are two futures m the OF,
the semple and the periphrasttc The stem for the former is formed by adding -sya-
or ‘isya- to the root with present termmations added on to1t This future has a
participle and an augmented conditional The periphrastic future 1s obtained from
agent-nouns m-tr The -ta- or -1td- 1s added to the root and then the forms of the
verb ‘to be’ are added on in the Ist and 2nd persons only The passive takes the
terminations of the middle voice and differs from rt in the present system only and m
the 3rd prs sg aomst In the present system 1t 1s obtamed by adding the suffix -ya-
to the root m its weak form and conjugating 1t in the middle voice \

As the OI particrples have played a very important role in the formation of MI
languages, we give below a somewhat detailed descrmption of the same The Acteve
present, future and aorst pariicrples are obtained by adding the suffix -ant to the pre-
sent, future and aorist radical stems respectively , as bav-ant pres p . bhav-isy-ant
fut p , vid-ant, sak-s-ant aor p The active perfect partecrple 1s formed by adding
-vims to the perfect stem which is always reduphcated cakrvims, tasthi-vims
The Middle and Passwe Participles . The future mddle, the pres pass and the pre-
sent middle of the first conjugation are formed by adding—mina-to the respective
stems, ¢ g , kar-isya-mina-fut mid , gam-y-mana pres pass ,labha-mina-pres mid.
Of the roots of the 2nd conjugation the pres part is obtained by adding -ima- to the
pres stem jus-dna-, bruv-ana-, pu-na-ana The perf, muddle is also formed by add-
ing -iina to the weak perfect stem~ iic-ina-, cakr-ana- etc The pref pass part is
formed by adding -ta or -ita to the root or by the suffixna -yé-ta, j1-ta, bhi-ta, sre-ta
h-na, dii-na, hi-na,etc The -ta often has an -1- prefixed to 1t in case of many roots _

The OT had a pitch accent with at Jeast 3 grades, the Iugh, the low and the middle,
which shifted from place to place im the word = But it was practically lost during 1ts
last phase It had the wonderful capacity for compounding two or more words in
different relations to form one dechnable umt —Two well-merhed stages can be
easily distinguished in the OJ (1) The older one represented in the language of the
pgveda and (2) the later one represented in the language of the Brahmanas,
Upamieads and that embodied in the Grammar of Pinim

12 Draleets in the OF

This OI had at least 3 dialects (1) In one, the IE*r and *] were treated as r;
this 1s the north-western dialect, akin to that of the Avesta, on which the literary
form of the old portions of rgveda 1s based, (n) In the second, the IE *r and *1 were
treated as] This was the dialect of the south-east of the Punjab and was removed,
more or less from the centre of the then Aryan culture (1) In the third dialect,
which was probably the central, the IE *r and *] were held apart, or this dialect
was a result of the mture of the above two Thus last 1s the Sansknt of Pinm:
The OI stage lasted from about 1200 BC to 600 BC.

13 Development of Early Middle Indian Dialects

the North-West, and in the Punjab, which were, so to say, the centres of
Imnguistic culture and radiation The Aryan population was thickest there
and the lngwstic traditions contmued to exist there in a purer form fora
longer period than mm the East and South where the Aryans were slowly but
steadily advancing and at every stage were getting proportionately thinner in num- -
ber 1n the midst of and while mixing with, the Non-Aryans, speaking foreign tongues .
The task of these borderland Aryans was therefore a difficult one They Had to pre-
serve the purity of ther language agamst odds and had to mmpose it upon them
Migrations to Saurastras m the West, were quick on account of the shortness of the
distance from the centre, and the to-and-from communications were frequent They
were also made by large groups as 1s seen from krenas story, and the settlements
were more compact on account of the small area of the Saurastra land , whereas im
the east, the case was totally different There was a vast land for the Aryans to
be scattered over, the distance from the centre mcreased as they progressed farther
east and communications with the centre must have been seriously handicapped:
The hngusstic traditions, therefore, changed earlier and more rapidly in the east than
in the west, and im the south In the centre also the language was changing, but
the changes were few and slow In this way, a pure form of OI was still in common
and free use in the Punjab dung the time of Panmi or even that of Patanjah, though
both of them do note the “corruptions” that had crept even at the centre Going
further back to the time of Yaska and even further back to the wnters of Pratisa-
khyas we find that they also note dialectical variations in the OI with reference to
different areas All this shows that the OI was changing right from 600 B C. or even
earlier, but the changes were not so great at the centre as to create distmct dialects,
whereas in the outslarts the dialects had begun to develop Among the dialects of
the outskirts, the western (2 ¢ , that spoken in Saurastra) and the southern showed
less changes than the eastern This 1s why we find the earliest sanskrit grammarians
noting the difference between Eastern and Western forms rather than between
western and southern ones The first reliable record however of the development
of chalectical differences in the OI on regional basis 1s supphed by the famous edicts
of Agoka (about 250 BC) But we know that about three centuries before Asoka,
Lord Buddha (500 BC) and Mahavira about 25 years earher had thought their
doctrines 1n their mother tongues, as OI was not understood by the ordinary people
of Bihar and Orissa That this form of language which we may call Old Magadhi
in absence of any other better name, must have existed at least two centuries before
the Buddha 1s easy to understand We can therefore say with confidence that the -
eastern form called the Old Magadhi had come into existence as early as 700 B. C
But we have not sufficient means to know exactly what kind of language it
was, because Buddhism very soon became an inter-provincial and, after sometime,
an internatonal religion. The Buddhistic monks who travelled in different western _
provinces of India preached their rehgion m the various western local dialects m
accordance with the instructions of ther Lord. The orginal dialect was thus soon
echpsed by the western forms But it appears that between 600 BC and 200 BC
the eastern form of language had much political and religious importance and was
understood all over India, as 1t was the religious language of the two ‘great reforming _
religions, and the political language of the great Agoka The famous edicts of Asoka,’

JOURNAL OF THE GUJARAT RESEARCH SOCIETY 13

to which we shall revert after some tnme, are said to have been first drafted in the
eastern language and were then published in diferent parts of India after making
only those changes in the original which would enable the people of distant provinces
to understand them without much difficulty. After Asoka the centre of politics,
culture and rehgion again shifted to the west, and when it was time to collect, edit
and put ito wnting the teachings of the two masters, a western literary form of
Janguage had to be selected for the purpose in order that 1t may be understood all
over the Aryan India This language was Pali, in case of Buddiusm and Ardhama-
gadIn, in case of Jainism That Adoka knew the religious teachings of Buddha in
an eastern form of language different from Pali 1s proved by one of his own inscrip-
tions.

V4. The WSokan Ldicts -

We shall now revert to the Agokan edicts We shall confine our remarks to the

“Western, Northern, Southern and Central edicts only, as the eastern ones whuch pre-
sent quite a different form of language are not likely to help us in our treatment of
Gujarat: The edicts at Shahbazgadhi and Mansera show purer forms of language
than those at Dhauh and Jaugada The edict of Girnar which 1s more useful for
Our purpose shows a purer form of language very similar to that found at Shahbaz-
gad and Kalsi, and widely differing from Dhaul and Jaugada — The difference be-
tween Girnar and Sopara fragment is not so great as would entitle us to count their
forms of language as two difierent dialects The difference between the eastern and
the western forms 1s observable in the followmg. (1) West r= East 1 Gir raja,
Dhauhi Jaya ; (2) the OI vowel -r- > -a-in the west and -i-in the east OL mrgah =
Gir, mago, North-west mrugo, East mige , (3) Skt -hs- = West -chh- and East -kh-°
OF vrksih =Gir. vachi, OI keudraka = Gir chhudaha; but East lukhim, khudaka
(4) The west nom sg m ends in -0, the East in -e, Gir. mago, East mage, etc The
difference between Sopara and Shah is not 0 great Thenorthern dialects show more
conservatism by preserving conjuncts and retaining uncontracted forms for a longer
time than Gir. and Sop : thus, north, dhramo, Gir dhammo, north mrugo, Gir_mago ;
north pnyasa, Gir piyasa; north majura, Gir mora Between Gir. and Sop, the
latter, being farther from the centre shows more changes thus, the use of cerebrals in
Sop for the dentals in Gir. and OI as OI pratividhino, Sop. patividhine, but
Gur. patividhino , the difference in vocabulary Gur thairinam but Sop vudhinam
(with cerebral for the OI dental -dh-) , the OI -hm- = Gir -mh- without shortening
the preceding vowel, but sop -mbh- with the compensatory shortenng Gur ba-
tnhana, Sop, bambha (na) The Sop shortens the long vowel before a conyunct, but not
‘the Gir bimhana, etc , Ol n > n Gir, but > nim Sop: OI dargana- Gir dasana,
Sop dasane, Gir. uramna, Sop luramna__Retension of the conyunct -st- in Gir. and
changing it to double stop in Sop Gir dhammanusasti, Sop dhammanusathi , con-
tractions in Sop. Gir. bhavati, Sop hot:, OI -jn- > Gir -fi-, Sop -jm - Gir rano,
Sop. réymo The changes noted above formed the bases for the further development
of the Sop dialect into Konkami and Maharastn The literary Pah bemg a stand-
ardized language shows a mixture of many idioms and dialects, but about a western.
dialect bemg its basis there 1s now no doubt.

(xvi) Consonant groups were further simplified into double ones

18 Cianges in the Apabhrmsa or the Late Mtddle Indian. Thus short stage marks
the transition of the MI into the Mod [languages Many phonetic changes did not
occur dunng this stage in the body of the word, but the end of the word, termmations
in particular, underwent so many changes that they undermined the whole OI
structure of dechnations and conjugations by bringing about confusion in the various
forms of words It became difficult to say from the mere form of a word, which
particular grammatical role it was hkely to play This confusion paved the way for
the analytical method of showing case and other relations which become such an
outstanding feature of the Mod I Janguages Phonetic changes ° (1) the Final -o and

ham and hatthe-hum (iv) The near denominative pronoun 4 came into existence
as distinct from -e- the remote denommative (v) Pres 1st pers smg ended im -um.

23 9 The Substratium. Languare .

But before we come to that question, itis necessary tohave a bird's-cye soos of the
substratum on which the Indo-Aryan was imposed during its life and spread in the
various parts of India It 1s now proved ly yond doubt that difterent tribes, non-
Aryan or «Aboriginal as they are sometimes called, had occupied the whole of Inde
before the Aryans entered it from the North-West When, after entering India and
during the long process of expansion and settlements the Aryans came in corttact
with the abongmal tribes, their relations were not always cordial = They had digas
and quarrels in which Aryans vere not always victorious and very often they nad to
compromise their attitude towards the non-Anans by marrying girls from the->
tribcs The enaihization of these tribes was well-adsanccd and, perhaps, hid cor
further in some respects than that of the Aryans = The cxeavations at Manjo-daro
and Harappa have proved tlus beyond doubt The abonginas know how to budd
cities and to fortify them, they hnew the use of metals, wood, carth and many
other articles of civihsation They were also well-advanced in arts and scenes
But they were not, perhaps, as compact as the Aryans, they were divided into
various tnbes and gangs, and were probably often at war among themseles Tres,
probably, lacked the strong and Inghly centrahsed patnarchical family organisitiot
which was a strong feature with the Aryans, and they were not as quick, strong and
active as the Aryans on account of their long stay in the hot portions of India The
Aryans used the swift vehicle of war, the horse, which these tribes wanted Whatever
might be the reasons, the Aryan invaders succeeded in the Jong rin in establishing
their superiority over the aborigins in 3 spheres the political, the social and the
linguistic As a result of compromise just as the Aryans had to give certain coaccs-
sions to the abongins im social and pohtical fields, in the same way they had to borrow
consciously of unconsciously, various linguistic factors from them We find re-
ferences as early as the Brahamana penod, according to which Vretyas were taken
up in the Aryan fold, and political status of the mlecchas had to be recogmzed
The same thing no doubt happened im the linguistic sphere

24 The Munda Languages .

Let us cast a glance at the languages of these abongmal tnbes There were
probably two tribes in India at that tme (1) The Austric-tribe called the Mundas
and (u) the Dravidians It 1s beheved that the Munda tnbes which are scattered
over a very large part of the world today were the earler occupants of India and
they were driven out partially, and conquered by the Dravidians who came later
Or both may be existing together in India from pre-histonc time, and later on the
Dravidians must have scored over the Mundas The Mundas had not much of cwill-

JOURNAL OF THE GUJARAT RESCARCH SOCILTY 19

zation and their language has, perhaps, not played an important role m the develop-
ment of the OF When the Aryans came , they were still existing m large numbers in
the Himalaya mountains and im the extreme north and cast of India. They are
identified with the so-called paidica tribes of the Himalayas on the basis the language
they spoke Following were the characteristics of the Munda dialects in India.
(a) Aggultination of the verb was a very promment feature with these languages

The verb ‘dal’ ta strike was aggultinated to ‘dal-ocho-akan-tahen-tac-tiii-a-e ’
meaning ‘he who belongs to him who belongs to me will continue letting himself to
be struck” (8) There was a glottal stop at the end of a large number of Munda
words (c) These languages distinguished gender on the basis of animate and inanim-
ate things, and not on the basis of sex asin IE languages (@) They had 3 numbers.
the singular, the dual and the plural Inke the OF — (©) There were 2 separate forms
for the dual in the first person, the onc taexclude and the other to include the person
addressed = Some was the case with the Ist pers pl (f) There existed the method
of adding suffixes and in'ives to the verbs (2) These languages had a categorical ‘a’
to make a statement = \aything spoken about a person in any number of words
would b2 incaprble of being understood as a statement if it was not followed by this
categorical ‘a Wecanseeat a glance from these characteristics that some, namely
(@} and (f) above evisicd in the OF also, while others did not When the Aryans
entered India, languages with the above characteristics were spoken all over India,
especially in North India The Linguistic Survey has revealed the exustence even to
the present day of many linguistic ‘islands of Munda languages in North India

Some of the most remarhable Munda “islands " are given here . Nanwar, Bunan,
Rangloi, Afanchit in Simla Hill States and round about , Rangkas, Darmiya, Byangsi
and Chandangsi in the mountains north of Gadhawal, Khambu, Vyakha, Vayu m
Nepal, Dhawal in Darjeeling , the big Khas: group in the Khast Hills, a large com-
pact area of Mundi: im Orissa and two somewhat small but very important “islands”
of Mundari in Central Provinces south of the Narbudda and in Madras near Ganjam

There 1s also a large patch of Mon languages from Rangoon to Amhurst in Burma

These languages are conspicuously absent in India South of the Central Provinces

On the basis of these data we are justified in assuming that Munda languages once
existed in the whole of North India evtending from the Punjab to Burma and as far
as the Central Provinces to the South It 1s noteworthy, however, that the whole
of the N W Frontier Provinces, the Punjab, Rayputana, Sind, Gujarat and the
country from Dellu to Benares covering to the South, Gwalior, Jhansi and Jubbul-

pore,—or to speak roughly, the Madhydesha and linguistic areas directly connect-
ed with the central or Madhyadesha language have no such “islands” Their ab-

sence in this part of India can be explained on the assumption that the Aryan lin-

guistic force was strongest here at the centre than it was in the outlying districts ,

and it was consequently successful in eradicatmg all the groups of Munda

languages from that area without leaving a single language “island” in this area

25 The Interaction of the Munda and the Drandian Languages
Coming to the Dravidian group of languages, we find the same phenomenon.

The Linguistic Survey has revealed a big Dravidian patch of the Brahui group in
aluchistan while some small, but, all the same, more important, ones 1n Central Pro-

vinces, Bihar and Onssa, They are the varinws forms of Gondi diilecte in Bhopal,
Nagpur, Wardha, Balaghat, Chana, Sambatpur and Rawadh A small patch of
Matto in Upper Biharisalso sigmficant. Besides the above patches, the great Tamil,
Telugu, Kanarese and Malayalam areas covermg the whole of India South of Gow are
too well-known to be mentioned ‘These islands hie the Munda islands are absent
inthe Madhyadesha, Rayputana, Gujarat and Sind Tf the finds of Mohanjo-rlaro
and Harappa prove to be the representatives of the Dravidian er ihization—an opimion
to which modern research 1s more and more inclined, there is ttle difficulty yn as-
suming that the Dravidians on the strength of their superior civilization and culture
defeated and partially at least drove away the semi-barbarian Mundas in the hills
of the Himalayas, Vindhya and Khiis, and into the outlying districts of India such
as Onssa, Bihar, Burma, etc. The problem, then, secms to have bern reduced to the
following terms * when the Aryans entered India, the language which they brourht
with them had to face the Dravidian languages in the maim and also some forms of
Munda Janguages which perhaps had survived the overpowenng influcnce of the
former, but vf existing at all at that time, with some sitality, they were fast dying
out from almost the whole of India, excepting the parts noted above As at 15 clear
from what 1s said above that the Dravidian group had to bear the mam brunt of
facing the Aryan specch in India, :t will be very instructive if we give below, some
of the maim characteristics of these languages

26. Features of Drandian Langitages :

The Dravidian languages are (a) poly-syllabic as opposed to the mono-sy Habic
ones of China, for which we shall have to say a few words later on (8) They belong
to the aggultmative group. The process of agglutination is illustrated above in the
treatment of the Munda languages (c) In this group, imanimate and irrational
nouns have the neuter gender. (@) The difference in gender 1s shown by suffiaing
a separate well-known word in which the gender-idea is prominent (ce) The Dra-
vidian nouns phrase themselves with post-positions (f) The Dravidian adjectives
are mdechnable ze they do not change gender and number in hermaony with the
nouns they quahfy (g) The Dr languages make a free use of participles for adjec-
tives (i) They possess the Inclusive and the Exclusive Ist pers p! pronommal forms
(g) The Dravidian group has no separate form for the passive, which they make
analitically by using a verb meanmg ‘ to suffer’ (h) These languages have a great
partiality for using participles for the actual full-fledged verbal tense-and-mood-
forms of Conjugation (t) They use some relative participle nouns in places where
the Aryan Janguages use relative pronouns,

27 = Trbeto-Burman Languages :

Besides the Munda and Dravidian languages, there was probably one more
group of languages current in India at the tyme of the Aryanimmugration. They were
the Tibeto-Burman and Tibeto-Chinese languages Even if their exastence in Indsa
as early as about 1000B C can be proved, they were mostly confined to the East , and
the Saurastra and the neighbourmng Western Coast of India (modérn Gujarat) with
which we are“concerned here more particularly was practically unaffected by them.

Gth centun BC cannot so etsaly and 69sonn become an mternational religion spread-
ing in Cluna, Tibet and Burma, m sone eases, even carher than it spread in other
parts of Indniitesif We pave below, therefore, some of the most important features
of the languages of the Tibeto-Burman group (1) Words are mono-syHabic. (1)
Modifications in meanines exprese dd by full words are brought about by adding fresh
words, called emptv words which exprass grammatical rations (in) Tone 3s a
grammatical catego, ie, dbfhicrent tones civen to the same word alter its meanmng
(Qs) There 16 a frequeat use of the dlottal step (x) There exist unexploded stops at
the end of words, and (01) the rreat importance of Sorder of words’ as a powerful
category of grammar Of these charactermtic-, Nes (iv) and (v1) are common to
Munda languages

The Linc astic Postion atlie Lime aftie Ursin Congest

In short, following was the final linguists postion of India, when the Aryans
entered it) There wore the Dravidian Ianeures sin full plavin the whole of India,
they had practically supere ded the carter Mund? Tunqueges whieh in their urn
had occupied the whole of Indi: prior to the comun: of the Dravidrin languages
The Munda languages were not completa overtud by the Dravidian ones when
the Arans came in, but thar strenmth head dumm hed, as they were decaying In
the east,r¢,in modern Assam, Boreal, Oresa and probibly also in Bihar, languages

languagcs in thar most p wverful form and the Mund: ones im a decaying stage in the
North, South and West parts of India Tr the East, € had to face the influence of

the Tibeto-Bunnan and Tibeto-Clum se groups in addition to the Dravidian and
Munda languages

28 The Development of Dialects in th. MI ths Last Secedes firs!

Keeping in nund ths substratum, we shall now revert to the question of the
distnbution of MI dialects

The OF had begun to change as soon as the Aryans came into Indias In the
rgveda, which embodies the literary form of the oldest Indo-Aryan speech, we al-
ready find a miture of new words with the old In the later Samlutus and the
Brahmanas, the number of new forms of words became large Wrong pronuncia-
tions based on the corrupt forms of words and confusion in accent, we are told, have
brought about the defeat for the Asuras and victory for the Devas The Asuras
are described as bemg entirely unable to speak the correct sacred Aryan language,
and were consequently misunderstood by gods In the Pratisakhyas, are noted
with meticulous care differences in pronunciations of the various schools of Vedic
recitation Many of these differences can be explained only on the assumption
that the rais of different places and different sakhas spoke the forms of OI language
which phonetically differed from one another im many respects Coming to Yaska,

22 THE LANGUAGE OF GUJARAT

the author of Nirukta, we find for the first time a clear mention of the development
of dialects on regional basis, which differred from one another not only im phonetics
but also im vocabulary. The OF of the rgveda had become sufficiently ummtcllieible
even to the learned and a controversy had already started in which one party held
with seriousness and vchemence that Vedas had no meanmg whatsoever Yaska
divides the words into two classes, the Vedic and the Bhiska (:¢ of ordinary
speech). Thus the later stage of the OI, called the Samskrta stage, was fully csta-
bhshed He also tatks of the differences in the languages of the Easterners and the
Westerners But they are not so great as to yustify us mm saying that two distinct
and mutually un-understandable dialects had come into existence So long as the
Aryans confined themselves to Brahmivarta, Kurupaficila, and Madhyadesa, ther
Janguage did not change fast But drastic and rapid changes started whan migza-
tions to the East and the South were made Panini, Kityayana and Patanyah
have so many references m their works which tell us about the corruption and
development of the OI into dialects that we are almost compelled to accept dialec-
tical difference even in the West at about 300 BC

Comung to the east the case was quite different The OL spreading, hke waves,
was actually being modified and getting feebler and feebler during the very course
of its advancement, and the changes were greatest at the casternmost end
where its force was practically completcly exhausted The dialectical varations,
therefore, developed earlier and more marked by in the East, say, as early as 700
BC when in the West a more or less uniform language was still spoken. Thus the
OI was first split up into two large groups, the eastern or the Pracya and the Western
or the Praticya growps The preference of Buddha and Mahavira (6th century
BC) for the local vernaculars as the medium of their teachings, the estabhshment
of the Eastern language as the court language of Agoka (3rd Century) and the
classification by the earhest Prakrit Grammanans of the Prakrit into the Lastern,
the Western, the Central and the Paisicu groups (Vararucht 200 .\ D) can be easily
explained on the basis of this division

The first stage of the development of the MI 1s charactensed by many changes
which were common to the whole Indo-Aryan area They consisted of the vanous
degrees of progressive and regressive assimilation of consonantal groups occurnng
initially or imtervoccally- thus, (a) a stop of one class + a stop of another class
> the double stop of the latter class eg OT -pt- > MI-tt-, Ol -bd- > MI -dd-,
(6) a sibilant +a nazel > the nazel +h. Ol -sn- > MI -nh-, OI, etc Con-
tractions hke (c) OI -aya- or- ai- > MI -e-, OI -au- > MI -o-, Of -ava- > MI -o-
But some special changes also developed dhalectically m the east (1) the Ol r >
MI -a- m the West and to -1- in the East (un) The sounds -r- and -1- which had dia-
lectical treatment in the pre-Indo-Aryan stage became once again a source of further
dialectical differences ‘The -t- was more common in the East than im the West.
(u1) The 3 sibilants were reduced to s m the West and in the East In grammar
the nom sg. m form of nouns m -a ended im -e m the east and incom the mam
language The Atmanepada and forms of uncommon tenses and moods lngered
longer in the West than m the East.

JOURNAL OF THE GUJARAT RESEARCH SOCICTY 23
29° The Himalayan Dialects secede net:

Coming to the North or the Himalayan remons, the OI was fast changing as it
came m contact with the hilly languages probably of the Munda family The
Mundas were aborigins who probably spoke decaying forms of their dialects in
which unvoiced sounds predommated over the vorced ones, and which were charac-
tensed by abeence of cerebrals in which the Dravidian languages were rich They
therefore changed the mtervocalic -g-, -d-, -b-, ete ito -k-, -t-, -p-, etc A few
words in OL, probably loans, show unauthorised unvoiced dental stops where the
oriminal He or Ir or OT has the voiced or cerebral sounds = The existence of these
words in the Samhitis enables us to assume the existence of dialectical developments
of the OI in the Himalava regions as early as the Samhuti period — Tnese hully form
of the OL are Jater on desembed by the Prakrit Grammarians as the Paisachi lan-
guage =To sum up the above remarha, we can say that the first sta of changes um
the OF was charactensed by three well-marked groups or blocks of dialects
(a) The ceatral or the main block, reaching as far as Saurastraim the West, Surpiraka
Avanti and probably Vidarbha in the South and covering the modern Rajputana,
the Punjab, the N WF Provinces and the Madhyadesa (the last consisting of the
ancient Brahmivarta, Kurupifichila and Matsya) — (b) The Eastern block covering,
Magadha, Vanga and Kahnga (1: ¢ modern Bihar, Bengal and Oriss1) The modern
Lastern Hind: area consisting of Kashi, Kosala and Vatsa was a connecting lnk to
these Ovo blochs — (ce) The Himalayan or the Patsachi block

30) The Sothern Dialect secedes ucvt fom the Centre \

During the second stage, the division was verticle, 1 ¢ , the Southern form was dif-
ferentiated from the Centre Thus stage 1s what 1s called the Prakrit stage During
this stage many common changes took place throughout the Indo-Aryan dialects,
but there were some which were spectral for different areas and which were respon-
sible for the further development and difierentiation of the MI languages into the
regional Praknts The Prikrit Grammarians give us a fair idea of the gwroth and
multipheity of these Prikrists lus stage must have-started earher than the Ist
century BC in the outlying districts and about a couple of centuries later at the
centre The earliest grammarian of this stage 1s Vararuchn He treats 4 Prakrits
which he calls (1) the Prikarit proper treated m detail, (1) the Paisachu, (in) the
Magadhi (iv) and the Saursem He derives the Prikrit proper from Sanskrit and
the remaining two from Saurasem: which also 1s said to be directly related to
Sansknit At the end of lus printed editions we find a set of siitris for Sauraseni
not commented upon by Bhimaha These siitrés are considered to be spurious
by some , but 1f we accept their view we have also to consider the sutris X, and
XI, in the sections on Paigachi and Magadh: to be spurious It 1s better there-
fore to take for granted the existence of 4 and not 3 Prakrits in Varamchr’s tune,

of which the southern form had become a hbrary language suitable for songs and
poetry on account of its hquid sounds. Once this southern form was raised to the
cigmty of a literary language, it cast off many of/rts local characteristics and became
eatensively used throughout India But a few specialities of the southern form still
remaimed attached to1t as did its name Some of these pecuhartties, eg, the in-

24 Til LANGUAGE OF GUJARAT

dechinable participle m -iina as different from the same im -it or -ya in Saurase nm
help us to associate this Pritkrit even in its Iterary form, with modern Marathi,
These grammarians it must be clearly understood were not writing grammars of
real spoken languages but of hterary Prikrits useful for dramatists who were re-
quired to put different Priknts in th: months of different type, of low chviracters
As Madhyadefa was the birth place of Tndian drama and as Saurasent was the
spoken language of cultured women of the country at that time, the early dramatist
had to see carefully that his Saurasent was quite correct Not so much care, how-
ever, was necessary for the other Prakmts as the audience of Madhyade‘a can
hardly be expected to have detailed knowledge of the other Prabrits The Drama-
tist therefore contented himself by writing the other Prakrits which were probably
not as correct as Saurasem, but which had ther sufficient prominent elriacteristics
to enable the audience to identify them with the respective, real, spoken Prikrits
We need not therefore expect detailed and scfentific accounts of the spoken language,
m these grammar books But whatever we get from them 1s of much value
to us in setthng the regional distribution of the Prakrits The grammarians late-
than Vararuchi increased the number of the Prakrits to five, six and even to sixteen
while the latest raised the number to 50 This fact broadly mmdicates that the
spoken dialects were getting differenciated among themselves in the course of a fu
Jater centuries But these later grammars are not so useful to us for the study of
the actual state of things im spoken Prikrit, as many of them were written waen even
these Prakrits were dead hiterary languages From Vararusiu we can say with
some degree of plausihhty that the OL had spht up during this period into (1) the
Central or the Saurasem block covering the old Brahmavarta, Kurupanchala, Mat-
rya, Saurasena, Avanti, Saurastra, Marudega and Sakadevipa or the area covered
by our Punjab, West UP, the country north of Narmada, Kathiawar, Sind and
Rajputana , (1) the Magadlu, area as stated before, with the Ardhamagadht are
covering from modern Benares to Sitapur in the North and Jubbulpore in South-
west , (im) the Mahiristri area mcluding Surpfraka and reaching upto Goa in the
South and covermg the old Vidarbha, Daksinipathi and Vindhya, 1e, covering
modern Amaraoti and the country north of Godaver:, and of course (iv) the
Paigachi area described before

31. Special Changes of this Stage

Of the changes that took place dunng this stage the most important and common
to all dialects were (1) the loss of some intervocalic stops hke -k-, -g-, -C- -J-,
(u) the imtervocalic -t- > -d-, (im) the intervocalic -n- > -n-, (1v) some vowel

contractions hke i+4>&%, e+a>e, o+a>o, {v) the shortening of long vowels
before the newly developed double consonants was made umform The differentia-
tion was effected by the following changes (1) Western forms were differentiated
from the Eastern forms by their treatments of sibilant and nom. sg m forms, etc,
as noted above, (u) In the Western group, the central or Satrasent was differen-
trated from the Southern or Maharastra group m (a) latters preponderance for
cerebral sounds instead of dental ones as noted in connection with the Agokan edict
fragment of Sopara , (6) in dropping the mtervocalic -d- and changing -th- and -dh

32 The Lahandt-P ayabs and Sind Arca secedes from the Centre:

These dieleeas commonly called the Prakrit languages continued to be spoken
during the Middk. aqcs upto about 650 4D The last stage of the MI, called Apa-
bhramaa, Cflected come further changes and was probably m common use till about
1000 ‘1D when the carher Modern Indian languages (of which Gujarati was one)
began to be charactenzed = Dunny the transition stage of Apabhramsa, the double
consonants began to be rendered single with the compensatory lengthening of the
preceding short vowcls Thus change was so far-reaching in consequences, that the
ML assumed the form of ModI cluefly on account of it The Punjabi escaped this
change altogether, and the Lahonda and Sidhu areas did so partially, for they sim-
plified the consonants but did not lengthen the vowel Thus the OI hastas ‘a hand’
which became MI hattho was, im the beginning of the ModI languages, hattho in
Old Punjabi, hatho m Old Sindh and Lahonda (cp Mod Lah hath and Mod.
Sindhi hathu) while in other languages 1t became hitho which gave, later on, the
form hith in GHB, ete , and hat in Marv. M and pahin languages Thus the
Sindiu, Lahonda and Punjabi areas were cut off from the central group This
probably happened somewhere about 1000 AD

33 = Ragasthant-Gigarat: Block Secedes from the Centre

About this time or somewhat later, another phonetic change was shaping itself
on account of which the whole Rajastham: block, consisting of Mod Marw, Mod
Mewatt, Mod Jarpuri, Mod Mewan, Mod Malvi, Mod Guy, and Mod Khandesh
was separated from the central Mod Hindi area, or as it is upto this time called, the
Saurasena area The split worked as follows —There was a large number of nouns
in the MI which ended in -ao m- and -aamn on account of the OI a-+an unaspirated
stop-+o and«a-+an unaspirated stop +am becoming -ao and-aam Of these groups

34. Jarpuri seecdes from the Gig-Marw-Malv: Bloch +

It 1s true that upto the Ith century Gujarati and the various Ryastham
dialects were quite akin to one another Even during the dsclopment of iic
analytical stage (from 1100.4 D onwards) when post-positions came to be employed
for different case relations, many of these dialects had post-positions, which
were commonto OldG Thus OG nar (13th century) dative post -pos appears as
na and nam in Mewati, Marwan and Jaipur: and as nem Guy and Malvi. The
WH has, in its stead, the one with ha- init) The present continuous idiom which
appears for the first time in Old G in the early 14th centurs 1s shared by the Ray.
dialects This idiom consists of the formula, the present tens> verbal form -. th?
present tense of the verb ‘to be’, eg, karaichar ‘1s dong... The WH and its dialects
have the pres part +the present tense of ‘to be’ as karti ha: Among the Ray.
dhalects, Guj has more affimty with the Maly, Marwari and, strangely enough, with
Ja:pun, though the last 1s separated from Gujarati by another dialect Mewan. For
example, Malvi and Jaipur distinguish, like Guy , the onginal v and b, while Mewan
and Marwari change them to b—an influence from the centre Jaipumi and Mewar
preserve the true future as does Gujarati. Jaipuri has chai ior the verb ‘to be’ as
in'Guj, Malvi and Marwari have hum ‘T’ as in Guy while the central dialects have
mat, etc But it appears that Jaipuri separated from the Guy -Marw-Malvi block
early in the 15th century Thus the idiom of continuous past tens2, eg Guy cilts
hata, ‘was waking’ constructed on the formula present participle of the mai verb +the
pres part of ‘to be’ which is found to have been evolved carls in the 15th century,
ze, later than the continuous present, 1s shared by Mali and Marwan along with
Gujarati but not by Jaipuri which, along with WH, has a difterent method Thus
we see that Gu) , Mal and Marw. were a uniform block till about the 15th century.

35 Marwar: and Malo secede from Guy :

The final separation of Guy from these two Raj languages came when the latter
two lost their neuter gender and Guy preserved it. Asa consequence the two Raj.
dialects had to transfer many neuter nouns to mas and some to fem Some distmct
post-positions were then adopted by each Finally the connection between Guy on
the one hand and the two Ray dialects on the other became less frequent as time
went The Raj languages turned again to the centre and resumed relations with it,

TOURNAL OF THe GUIARAT RUESLARCH SOCIETY 27

on account of political relations ‘They therefore developed the remanmg new
paradiems hke the penphrastic future ‘caltigh,’ ete , under the influence of WH.

86 Relations of Blatt Diahets uth Guy.

The existence of Bhih dialects on the borderland between Guy on the one hand
and Marwari, Malvi and Mewar on the other hand and ther vers close connection
with all the above Ianevaces prove the compactness and sohdanty of the Western
Dleck of speeches which may be calicd the Guj-Bhih-Rayastham Block But Bhilt
as more rolated to Guy than to Mer, Mew or Mal, because the Bhils remamed
m closer touch with the peaple of Gu. as Instory tells us than, with those of
Rayasthin in P4th, Tath and 16th centumes, Asa matter of fact, the Bhi languages
are nothing more than the drileets of Gujarati,

Here perhaps it will be better af we put ina nutshell the whole process of difier-
enuation and characterization of Guy The TE (2500 BC) had a branch called the
Anan winch (rahns, throurh \oa Minor, Mesopotamia and Persia split up (1500
BC) onto ramen and Indo-Aryan sub-branches = The Indo-Aryan in the form of
the OT be cana a big and pow rful independent source of further linguistic develop-
ment m India The carher stare of the OF, Reveda, (1200 BC) is called the Pn-
mative OF and the later onc, of the Brahmanas, ete , 1s called the later OI Thus OI
branched itsulf into the Eastern and the Western (700 BC) dialects The Western
form again spht up into 3 sub-branches (between 200 BC and 200 AD) as (a) the
Hilly or the Partachy Branch, (0) the Central or the Saurasena branch and (c) the
Southem or the Vidarbha er the Maharastra branch It was during this time that
the Ardhamacadh: form in Oudh, Ka, ete, was bemne difterentiated from the
Tastcurn as well as from the Western groups .\ further slice of area covering the
Mod Sindh, Punjabi, and Lahonda was cut off (between 800-1000 A D) from the
central bloch which now consisicd only of the Madhyadesha, Rajasthan, Gujarat
(including Sauragtra) and the country north of Vindhya ranges This block further
split up into the Guy -Ray area on the one hand and the Saurasena area on the other
at about 900-1100 AD = The Guy-Ray block was the last to secede from the centre
From the Guy-Ray block, Jaipuri was separated in the 14th century and the remaining
Guj-Mar-Mal group finally spht up into Guy on the one hand and Mar and Mal
on the other in the 15th century After this spht the Rajasthan: dialects resumed
their relations with the centre on political grounds, while Gu) continued to develop
independently The Bluls maintained more relations with Gujerat and for a longer
period than with Rajasthan, ther language 1s, therefore, so similar to Guy that
linguistically it can be classed as a dialect of Guy In the Ray -Guy block, the Guy.
area was probably the centre of lingwstic tradition corresponding to the Madhyadega
in the central block, as it has preserved the hnguistic traditions more faithfully than
any other language of Rajasthan

37° Old Gujarat ~The name OWR 1s unwarranted . .

We shall now resume the thread of our narrative of the development of Gujarati
which had reached as far as the last stage of the MI called the Apabhramsa
Immediately from the Apabhraméa, Old Gujarat: was born in the ith century We

28 THE LANGUAGE OF GUJARAT

have prose MS evidence reaching as far as the 12th century in which OG appears
as a fairly developed and well-established idiom —_It 1s true that many post-positions,
compound tenses and composite verbs which are the characteristic features of MG

are not found here, but a begining 1s already made. The post-positions OG mihi

>Mod G -ma, OG tanau> Mod G nau, no, OG sum> Mod G Si are already there
The ablative post-position has not yet developed, nor the dative Of the compound

tenses continuous past, type OG karatau hiitau> MG karto, hato, has just come into
existence and others are to come in the wake Thus this language has unmistakable
marks of the Gujarati language It 1s not desirable to call it either an Apabhraméa
or Old Western Rajastham The term Apabhraméa applied to this language will
require a connotation quite different from its ordinary one How 1s it possible, for
example, to call as Apabhram$a the languages treated by Hem in his Gram and
the OG language of the 12th century which are widely apart from one another? The
name OWR 1s unauthorised Neither the word Rajasthina nor the name Rajas-
tham appears to have existed in hterature of more than two centuries old, nor have
we any evidence that the language spoken over modern Rajasthan was ever called
Rajasthani in the past On the contrary we have references reaching as far as the
ith century in which the language of the whole Rajasthan-ci1-Guyarat tract was
called the ‘language of Gujarat ”’ Moreover, MG has remamed more faithful to
this form of language than the various Rayastham dialects, by preserving the neuter
gender, and by retaming such other characteristics as would warrant unbroken conti-
nity of Imguistic tradition, while the Rajasthani dialects have lost some important
old features under the newly established influence of the central WH It is therefore
desirable to call this language as Old Gujarati rather than by any other name This
should not be considered to be conflicting m any way with what 1s said above that
‘Marwan and Malvi severed their connections with Gujarati as late as the 15th century.
The traditions of Gujarati are more powerful and contimuous than those of any Ray
janguage Moreover a language does not cease to be called by its old name when a
part or parts of its area fall off uts linguistic unity Sauraseni has had several such.
amputations and still 1t has retaimed its origmal name and its central position

38 A sketch of the OG Grammar .

Followmg is a brief description of the OG of 1200 AD to 1600 AD Innouns
there were two main types (a) the old type m which the imtervocalic stop at the
ending part of the word did not disappear, 7 ¢ , the type where OI hastas > MI hattho
>OG hathu , and (6) the new type where this consonant disappeared bringing the
two vowels together, +e, type OI ghotakas > MI ghodao > OG ghodau. In the
old type there were only three sub-types namely, (1) the first consisting of OF and
MI nouns in -a, and -u thus OI hastas, etc , and OI caficus gave OG hathu and OG
camcu, (u) the second consisting of nouns mImfn OT hastn>MI hatthi> OG
hathi (-u, extended) , Of aksi> MI akkin> OG akhi (um) The -a of the old fem nouns
was contracted mto-a eg 1 malé>MI -mata> OG mala The second or the new
type was very large, m fact many nouns from the old type were extended to this
type by the addition of -u m, um n- to facilitate the expression of gender In ths

the voice sowids, pure as well as nazel

42, The Classification of Vou ds

Vowels are classified according to the position of the tongue When the front
of the tongue 3s raised as Jugh as posable consistent with the position of the generation
of vowel sounds and the back of the tongue 15 not raised, we get the front high or the
front closed vowcl By lowerng the front httle by little we get a senes of front
vowels which are half-closed, half-open and open respectively Similarly, when the
back of the tongue 1s raised to the highest position consistent with the generation of
vowel sounds, we get the Inghest-back-vowel called the closed-back-vowel , and
then by lowering the back of the tongue httle by httle, we get a simular series of half-
closed, half-open and open back vowels The quality of the vowel 1s clearer, the
more 1t 1s closed im front or back It becomes blurred or indistinct when instead
of the back and the front parts of the tongue, the middle of the tongue plays a part
im its generation without being raised or lowered to any remarkable degree, or shortly,
‘when the tongue 1s nearer 1ts normal position The vowels generated in this way are
called central, some of which are nuteral The following fig gives in a tabular form
the charactenstic lnghest position of the tongue indicated by a dot at the time of the
generation of each particular vowel-sound These are the ideal positions or the
positions for what are called the cardinal vowels The positions for the Gujarati
vowels are indicated by small squares in the same figure for the convemence of
comparison *

* Vide Appendix L

34 THE LANGUAGE OF GUJARAT

These are the pure vowels, There are also the sazal varteties of Nos. 1, 5, 6,
7,10, 12. When a close vowel 15 nazalized it opens up shghtly, and the front vowel
tends to go back under the same circumstances There are only two true diphthongs
ai and ou as they are syllabic = The group fi and iv are often contracted into thes:
diphthongs. There are several vocahe groups of two or more vowels but they form
more than one syllable: ¢g, ui, co, cu, e1, 01, o1¢, cic.

43, Consonants:

Stops have 3 movements: the on-glide, implosion or the movement of adyust-
ment of the organs; the stop or the position of utter blochade of the air-current ;
the off-glide, explosion or the movement of release. The fast movement plays larger
part with regard to the audibility of the stop. Tf the air force 1s extra-strong we get
aspirated stops, 1f it 18 ordinary we get stbps Tf vocal chords vibrate during this
time we get the voiced sounds, otherwise we get the unvoiced ones When the stop
is made by two lps we get labials , when it is made by the tip of the tongue against
the upper teeth, we get dentals; when the front of the tongue stops the air passage at
the back or the front of the hard palate we get palatals of various kinds ; and when
the back of the tongue creates a stop with the velum, we get the velers or the so-called
gutteral sounds In the above cases, the various parts of the tongue come into con-
tact their respective upper organs (see chart above) ; but im creating the retroflax
sounds, the so-called cerebrals or linguals, a part of the tongue (usually, the typ or
the blade) touches not its normally upper organ but the one which 1s farther mside
the mouth removed from if by one or two steps Thus the tip does not touch the
teeth, but the teeth-ridge or hard-palate ; the blade of the tongue does not touch the
teeth-ndge, but the hard palate, and so on Gujarati has that class of retroflax
sounds in which the tip of the tongues stops the breath at the front-hard-palate.

36 THE LANGUAGE OF GUJARAT

44 Morphology

Gujarati words can be grouped into the four traditional classes They are (1) the
Nouns, including substantives, pronouns, numerals and adjectives; (1) the Verbs
including the temporal and modal forms, and participles; (11) The Adverbs and post-
positions and (iv) the Indechnable particles Nouns, some participles, adverbs and
post-positions have dechnations, verbs have conjugations whule the particles have
only one immutable form

45 Nouns

Gujarati nouns end in (a) one or more vowels, pure or nazal and in (2) one or
more consonants Thus, bi, bhibhi, bipi, vhe, gho end in a single vowel, while
bin, ghad, kw, phos, saraio, etc end in two or more vowcls, and ghar, lol, patr,
kast end in one or two consonants Morphologically, they can be grouped as (1) the
strong nouns and (1) the weak nouns The strong nouns distinguish number, gender
and case by special forms, wlule the weak ones distinguish only the Inst Ioc case
from the Direct-oblique The nouns ending in -o, all masculine, and those in -0,
all neuter, are strong , the remaining are weak
46. Number - 1

There are two numbers in Gujarati, the singular and the plural Weak nouns
do not distinguish them ordinanly, while the strong nouns do Thus hith sg and
pl , basg and pl ; bhiisg and pl , but ghorosg, ghora pl, chokrim sg , chokri pl
But to make the plural explicit in a sort of formal way the vowel -o 1s added on to
the weak nouns and also, for the sake of uniformity, to the strong nouns at the end.
in ordmary conversation, however, 1t is not often used, the idea of plurality beg
left to be gathered from the context Thus hithsg hith-o pl , bhai sg, bhar-o;
ghoro sg, ghori-o pl , chokrii sg, chokri-o pl.
47. The Case

There are 3 cases in Gujarati (1) The Direct for the Nominative and Accusative
(2) the Instrumental Locative, a common form for the two cases and (3) the Obhque
for the other cases and for appending the post-positions There are no separate
treminational forms for sg and pl except mm the Direct case of strongnouns The
strong nouns distinguish the three cases, but the weak ones have a common form for
Direct and Oblique, which differs from the Inst Locatave form The old Inst Loc
forms of the weak nouns have been levelled down by usage and have fallen together
with the Direct-Obhique form, leaving thus a single form to express all cases and
numbers But later on the termimation -e was superadded to the old Inst Loc
forms to distmguish them from the Direct-Obhque forms Gender does not affect
the case forms of weak nouns Declmations of noun differ from those of adjectives.
They are, therefore, treated separately

Sl. Participles .

Active Participles are formed by adding different suffixes to the present active stem
and passive participles are formed by adding suffices to the passive stem. Wren
they are extended, they distmmguish gender and number, but the unextended ones
donot The absolute participle and the Infinitaves are formed by adding suffixes to
the present stem of the verb Following participles are available in Guyarats:

1. The present parherple active 1s obtamed by adding -at which appzars (1) 10
the extended forms as in -tom, tif, tiin and (u) in the unextended forms as -at, 1ts
-a- merges with the preceding vowel in case of strong verbs Thus, extended jin-to,
-ti, td , de -to, -ti, -t , unextended yin -at, de-t, pi-t

2. The past participle appears m several forms all of which are of the extended
vanity The OI past part suffix -ta was directly applied to some consonantal roots
and as a result of assimilation of the two consonants, different consonantal groups
developed, which were reduced to double consonants im the MI, these double cons
were reduced to single ones in the Mod I and the whole form was extended. This
1s an wregular class Thus khi-dhit, di-dhi, ptdhi, si-ti, bhind, etc (1) When
the -ta was apphed with a connecting -1-, the conjunct was avoided and the form
developed mto -iom in the MI It became-m in Apbh, 1u m OG and -yom -i, f and
-yinimMG Esamples jin -yin, lakh-yom, pi-yin, ga-yiin, dekhgf This 1s the

53 It The Causal

1 The causal stem is obtained from the primutive pres stem by adding the suffix
-av- OF -iiv-, or -f- or -it-; or by various combinations of av and ar, iir, such as -var-,
-oriv-, -ariiv-, -variiv-, variiv- added to the primitive roots The rules of distnbu-
tion of these suffixes in the verbs are too complicated to be mentioned here The
radical a or & becomes a and a long i or ii becomes short before any one of these
suffixes The suffixes beginmng with -v- are generally taken by the strong verbs
The last four suffi\es are for the double causative forms The suffix -v- 1s the com-
monest kar-,,ker-iiv-, bhan-, bhen-av- (old), bhan-dv- (new), dhav-,dhov-ar-,
Si-, Su-vit-, kha-, kha-voriiv- or kha-,vorav- or khe-var- or kho-vir-, de, de-var~

42, THE LANGUAGE OF GUJARAT

2. The Old Indian causal has remamed im MG in many verbs, but it 1s, now,
more useful for converting an intransitive verb into the transitive, with the causative
sense altogether superceded in many cases and a new verbal sense developed in a
few. The transitive formation 1s also accompamied by a high-grade radical vowel in
the stem Thus, the radical ‘a’ becomes &, regularly and ‘e’ sporadically Often a
‘causative suffix 1s found added on the top of the transitive stem —

54 Post-Posttions :

True post-positions are the case forms of old nouns which have lost their meanmg
entirely and acquired grammatical function They are not used mdependently, but
only after a noun and express relations including those formerly denoted by different -
cases They are strong and weak, the strong showmg different forms for gender
‘number and case and are declmed ike adjectives They are. vali, vate for the

Instrument, ne, mite for the Dative, thi for the Ablatwve,nom,nif,nu n kene

for the gemtive and ma bham, vise for Locative relations There 1s another class
of post-positions which are also adverbs and are used as mdependent words Some
of them are fiper, nice, mathe, hethe, marphat, ldhe, vaste, sathe, vind, vagar,
lagi, sudhi, etc

The OI had a large number of verbg expressing various shades of action,
but ther number became smaller and smaller 1n the MI and by the tzme we reach the-
ModI stage many of them showing fine shades and differences have fallen into dis-
use Verbs of general and colourless actions such as kare, bole, jay have survived
The loss 1s made up by creating new verb-phrases consisting of two words in which
the last member 1s a verb of general umport and the first member is erther a noun or an
adjective connected with the verb or an infinitive-absolutive form of another verb .
Thus raj kare ‘rules,’ mam pare, ‘names’ hath ave ‘1s found out’, mar khay ‘is beaten’,
mari gayo ‘died’ Some of these general verbs are ya, cik, nakh, par, par, sak, le, de,.
the av, tha It is interesting to note that these verbs of general import change their
original meammng and are almost treated as auxiliary ones They also modify the
meaning of the preceding member m various ways kor nakh, Jaile, joto rhe, show
quickness , mar nakh- shows completion of the action, lakhya kar shows continuity ,
c&lto tha shows the begmning, etc Such groups are, practically, the verbs and are
conjugated hike the final verbs m each group We call them the verb-phrase or the
‘composite verbs and they are to be distinguished from the compound tenses noted
above ’

57 The Sentence

The sentence 1s a word or a group of words which predicate something about the
subject expressed or understood. The subject 1s a noun ze, a substantive, a pro~
noun, an adjective ora numeral The predicate 1s a verb ora participle, or a noun or
their combmation When the sentence 1s a verb or a phrase contammg a verb, it 1s
called a verbal sentence jhoro, khay che, bhaijay, hui avi When the predicate is a
noun or a participle, the sentence 1s called a nomenal sentence but 1t expresses the
various tenses quite correctly. Thus hi geyo (past tense), te yoto (habitual past) ,
nokar avelo (past, with expectancy mcomplete), ghoro avvt (conditional), tamare
jaui (mild mmperative) etc When a substantive or an adjective comes as a pre-
dicate 1t shows sumple predication e kharii mari ném ran, temdr vat sici All
the verb phrases described above, when used as predicate, go to constitute a sentence

SS Agreement beticcen the Subject and the Predicate .

The verbal forms of the predicate require the subject in the direct case and the
verbal form agrees with the subject in person and number hit jit chi’, bipu avée,
bhai jiiv. tamé hes» When a participle 15 used as the predicate the gencral practice
is to put the subject in the Direct case before active participles and in the Ins case
before the pasave ones The pres act and the pot-past. pass part have stuck to
this oid pratice, the former always requnring the Direct case and the latter the Inst
Whether the verb ss transitive or intransitr.e = Thus, the pres part ghoro dorto,

bhin fivat, pot part + magné path vey 4, bhaie ivovii But there 1s considerable
discrepancy when the past pass part 1s used Generally speaking the past part

of the transitive verhs requires the actual doer or the agent in the Inst and the object
im the Direct case, thus, mé rotls khidha, magne nigal jor ‘In the case of past

participles of intransitive verbs, the plssive scnse having been worn out, the parti-
ciple is for all practical purposes 1s treated as active and the actual doer of the action
is put in the Direct case mstead of in the Inst magan ramy93, gis ivi, chokro bolyo

The predicate mm all the above cases agrees in gend , number and case with the subject
in the Direct case} Buta few complications due to further development and psycho-
logical contamination have however taken place in the transitive verbs It is an OL
practice that when the speaher docs not want to bring out the transitive nature of a
verb by using a noun in the accusative case, he simply uses the tr verb intransitively,
2¢, omits the object Thus practice gathered a momentum 1n some transitive verbs
to such an extent that they became practically intransitive verbs Many verbs of this
class reverted to the practice of the Intr verbs, 7¢, they required the agent in the
Direct case in the past-part construction, though strictly speaking they ought to
require the agent in the Inst Thus the verb jam- ‘to dine has hu yamyo not mé
yamyt although the verb khi- ‘to eat’, has m-© khidhi

Whth reference to the transitive verbs which require the agent in the Inst case,
the practice of using the object in the Direct case is again not umform A large
number of such verbs require the object m the Direct case and the participle predi-
cate agrees with it in gender, number and case; thus mé rotlikhidhi, mg rotlo khadho,
mé natak joyd But when the verb has two objects or when a different shade of
sense 3s to be expressed by the participle, the object 1s followed by the post pos né
If there are two objects, one appears in the Direct and the other beforen@ Even
in cases where there is only one object, the post n@ 1s used before it to show another
sense, thus coré bai miri ‘the thief killed the woman’ but coré bai n€é man ‘the
thief beat the woman’ or cor bar ng miryt ‘the thief beat the woman ’ or again coré
bia né lakn, dando, lakri min, amaryo, mary So also one can say chokre citra
JOY n as also chokre citra ng joyu, with a shght change in sense

Coming to the use of genuine MG passive verbs and MG passive particrples, they
require the noun eapressmg the agent'in a phrase before the post pos thi eg, chokra
thi kim korayti, pith vanciyo, copri jovai The object here, as in the case of some
participles noted above appears in the Direct and the predicate which is a passive
verb or a new pass part agrees with the object in person, gender, number and case

"as the case may be =

AG THE LANGUAGE OF GUJARAT

There is a third vanety of construction in which the old or new passive participle
or the transitive or the intransitive verb in the passive voice 1. used without ex-
pressing the object at all In such a case, the verbal form having no word in the
sentence to agree with appears m the 3rd sg and the partiniple in the Dr. sz n,
eg, magne khidhi, tenith: bolayd, marath: colatd, dosiths have yovatii nth. In
Indian grammars these 3 constructions are called the three prayogas They can be
defined as follows (1) when a verb or a participle used as a verb agrees in person,
number, gender and case with the noun expressing the actual doer of the action which
1s put in the Direct case, we callit as the Kartar: Prayoga of the predicate (2) When
the verb on the other hand agrees in person and number and the participle in number,
gender and case with the object of the verb whuch is placed im the direct case or in
rare instances in a post-positional phrase ending in né, while the noun expressing
the doer is not placed in the Direct case, we have the Karmani Prayoga of the pre-
dicate (3) When the object of the verb is noi expressed at all and the agent is also
not placed in the Direct, :¢, when there is no noun in the Direct case in the whole
sentence, the predicate verb takes 3rd per sg and the participle takes the Dir sz
n form. This use of the predicate 1s called the Bhave Prayoga Hlustrations are
given above

59 Compound and Complex Sentences :

Compound and Complew sentences are constructed in Gujarati in the same way
as they are done in other Indo-Aryan Janguages by using co-ordinatmg and sub-
ordimating conjunctions and pronouns ¢g.,comp . chokra avyo on gaya, complex:
je chokro avyo te gaya, mned. je chokra ivyo te yemyo one gays, etc They,
therefore, do not call for any remarks

THE DIALECTS OF GUJARAT
GO General -

Practically no research work has been done in connection with the Dialects of
Gujarat. Siw George has remarked, perhaps on the superficial information made
available to him by his informants, that Gujarati has practically no dialects In
his linguistic survey, he has given a few examples of the forms of speech spoken in
North, Central and South Gujarat and a specimen from Kathiawar. He has also
noted a few but salient pecuharities of these forms of speech As a matter of fact
on deeper mnvestigation, we find that Gujarati 1s singularly fortunate in having a very
Jarge number of dialects These dialects are (a) Regional, thats, confined to different
particular areas and spoken by almost all men of the area m a comparatively umform
manner ; there are also (5) the Tribal dialects or the special dialects spoken by certam
tribes and communities who came from outside and settled here, but who did not
entirely give up them old language Gujarat, we know, has given shelter to an un-
usually large number of such tribes from outside Speaking from the Regional
pomt of view, Gujarat splits up into two natural parts, the Peninswlar Gujarat or
Saurastra or Kathiawar and the Gujarat on the mam landofIndia The mann land,
being longer north-south than east-west sphts up mto 3 natural divisions: North

Gujarat reaching as far as Ahmedabad district to the South and called Gujarat
proper , Central Gujarat called Carotar reaching as far as a few miles south of Baroda
and South Gujarat including Surat and Broach Districts The Central portion,
Carotar, in the castern side called Panch-Mahals shows a difference in language and
should be considered as an area speaking a dialect of Standard Carotar1 Saurastra
divides itself regionally mto Jhalawar, Gohelwar, Halar, Sorath and

Ohhamanral.

Gl. Marin Dialects -

The language of North Giyarat shows unmustakable influence of Marwari.
The fact 1s perhaps that an old form of the Janguage of this areca was overlaid by
another one having more resemblance with Marnvan Relations of North Gujarat
and its capital Patan with Rajasthan in the Middle Ages were very close and lasted
upto the time when OG was already a spoken language The Central area, Carotar,
1s easily distinguishable from the North and the South areas The language of this
area shows a large influence of aboriginal specch In old times the inhabitants of
Carotar had perhaps very close relations with Bluls and other abonginal tnbes ;
Carotan dialect 1s therefore highly saturated with the clements of abonginal speech
The affricate pronunciation of palatals sounds, the use of Ist pers of the verb for
the 2nd and the non-Aryan pronunciation of h, prove the highly influenced nature
of Charotan The story of the South is quite different The country south of Nar-
budda was Konhan and a form of language akin to old Maharastri was spoken there.
Gujarati has reclaimed 1t comparatively recently The language of tlus part, there-
fore, shows close similarity with the Konkni dialect of Marathi noteably in the
cerebral pronunciation of dental sounds, etc., the characteristics of the dialect of
Sopara, the capital of Konkan for a long time noted as early as the time of Agoka.
The oldest form of Gujarati language 1s perhaps to be found in Kathawar, Bemg a
peninsula and approachable by land through only onc route, the language of Kathiawar
has preserved many old forms the 2nd sg pres m Kathrawar does not end in a
termination—which 1s a late innovation but in the radical vowel or consonant , eg,
tt kar, tf khé, li jo where St. Guy has ti kore, ti khiy, ti jue,etc The distinction
between Inst and Loc forms of nouns 1s still observed in Kathiawar by nazalzmg
the inst form eg, hithé ‘with a hand’ and hathe ‘m the hand’ In Kathawar
itself, perhaps the oldest form of language 1s found 1n Sorath, which supplies the earhest
evidence of Aryan settlements and consequently the erliest existence of Aryan
speech in the area The famous temple of Somnath, the burial place of Knsna,
called dehotsarg near Veraval, the edicts of Agoka, Rudradaman and others at Girnar,
the Buddhistic caves in sana dungar, the Uparkot of Junagadh are too well-known
to the student of Indian history Moreover, the influence of foreign mvasions and
foreign rule has been at its minimum here on account of its great distance from Vi-
ramgam District, the gateway of Kathiawar The Mahommedan rule m Junagadha
has not affected the language of the masses The next linguistically 1mportant area
im Kathuawar 1s Gohelwar, the area of old Vallablupur, of the famous Jain temples
at Palitana and the 2 place of early settlement of Brahmms at Sihore

48 THE LANGUAGL O1 GUJARAT

Okhamandal comes next in importance from the linguistic pomt of view, This
small desert-like patch of Jand has an old form of Janguage uninflurneed by cducation
Being the place where the famous Dwarka temple 15 situated, 1t has preserved many
old customs and forms of speech. Jt should be noted that modern reacarch doubts
the location of ongmal Dwarka in this area and 1s inclined to put it near Verawal in
Sorath Jn Halar, the old language is overlaid by a form imported from Karch called
the Jarey dialect, when the Jiireyis of Jamnagar, Gondal Dhrol, Rajkot, cte —ell
in one group occupied Halar The accent, the intonation and the phrasing of this
dialect 1s so obviously different from those of the rest of Kathmawar that this dialect
can be most esily detected from among the group of the dialects of Kathiawver The
Jhalwari dialect represents a stage in which one form is overlaid with another having
some similarities with the language of Thar and Parkar The Jhales came to Kathia-
war by that route, only two centuries ago Patri, Jhinjhuwara, and a portion Chival
were under Dhrangadra, the centre of Jhalarculture in Kathiavar Besides these
five regional dialects, there are some dialect-islands or small arcas of old forms of
speech scattered here and there not overlaid by subsequent forms of specch They
are Babariawar and Sarvaiiwiir or the lands of Baibars and Saris respectively.
The language of Barbaras and Sarvains have assumed the local character here Their
charactenstics are not studied by any one as yet

62 Some Characteristics of the above dialects are noted below

Kathiawadi in general The vocal group -i1 1s contracted to -a1. SMG bhi
Kath bhai, SMG khii=Kath kha: The consonantal sift a gutteral consonant
++1 or y=the corresponding palatal vowel+1 or y SMG kahisKath haci, SMG
‘khiskoh=Kath Chiskoh , SMG giyo=Kath jryo, SMG ghea=Kath jhee, ete

The quolloquial Loc-Inst palatahzes the ending consonant thus SMG hith
avyo ‘was found out ’=Kath hith, a-vyo, SMG giim giyo ‘went abroad =Kath
gam, jiyo

The old palatal c and ch=s ordinarily but=$ 1f followed by 10ry except in Halan

Thus SMG cor=Kath sor, SMG cira=Kath Sire, SMG chias’=kath sis, SMG chibi
s=kath Sibu, SMG che=kath se The auwhary verb ‘to be’ appears always as‘s’
instead of ‘ch’ SMG miareche—Kath mare sé etc

S appears as h (unvoiced) SMG sisi=Kath hihi, SMG sit-Kath hit,
SMG das—Kath dah Preservation of § SMG and Kath stk, SMG and Kath si,
etc The Middle Indian -h- is ehded This 1s a very promment characteristic of
Kathiawan SMG vahu=Kath vau, SMG rahe=Kath re , SMG kahe=Kath ke,
some grammatical pecuharities are also noteworthy Kath has the dem pron i

mstead of e, and forms lke ino, iya, im instead of e-no ‘his’, ty@ ‘there’ and em ‘in
that way,’ etc The plural of nouns end m u, whichis an old feature bai ‘a woman’,
bait ‘women’, manas, manhu, In conjugation, unlike the standard Gujarati the
2nd pers sung. differs from the 3rd pers sing thus 2nd sing tu mjra-s—SMG tu
mare che but 3rd sg te mare-se Thelst pl pres of ‘to be’ 1s saryé instead of SMG
hie eg omé Kathiawar saié The Imperative 2nd pers sing 1s 1dentical with the

JOURNAL OF THE GUJARAT RLSLARCH SOCILTY 49

pres 2nd sing and in both cases the ending radical consonant 1s palatalized, as, lakh,
‘write’ or ‘thou wnte' The old passive suffix om -ano 15 in fuller use in Kath. than
on the mainland Kath bhrins=Gu) bhriya This 1s a very outstanding charac-
teristic of Kathiawars, and the inhabitants of Gujarat proper detect rmmediately the
Kathiawan: Jangnage from this pass part Some strong verbs appear in strong form
m Kath Kath ji-wisSMG javil ‘to go, Kath thiviisGuy thavil ‘to be’ Coming,
next, to the dialects in Kathiwar, Jhalawan has some peculiarities special words

cam ‘why’, Lidht: (instead of SMG hoahvit) ‘told’, phih yay=SMG pakri ji, Kath
fm niim=SMG tem ni tem ‘ yust im the same condition", ad ‘deep part of the lake ,’
Thal olyo=SMG pelo ‘that', Jhal padr=SMG gira, Thal. rav hhavizSVMG phariyad

karvi ‘to complain, Thal bhet bhetia ‘clase to each other’, Phal rohii=SMG Terai ‘a
fight’ Jhal soricSMG chohri, sorthisohkri, Jhal. .alavieSMG batavi ‘showed’ etc

Halart has Ga=SMG ty, hi=SMG hav, tax g=SMG tyare, Tha Halari
speaker often uses the word bholi ‘o, good man’ In short intervals in the sentence,
The Halan converts every 4tos* SMG 4isHal si’, even the future forms have s,
not §. hhist sii ‘what shall we cat ?°

The sorth: dialect has the smallest number of Iws from any other
language including Sanskrit, Urdu, Hinds, Persian and European languages

The Gohilwan changes § to h SMG Sik=Goh hik, SMG sihor=Goh hyor ;
SMG $i khobar ‘I do not know'=Goht hi Mhobar = The vocabulary 1s also different :

for SMG panéo, Goh. has phadiyil; also note, Jhal ya, Hal paisa, Sorth kavariyd.
It 1s not possible to deal with these dialects in detail yust now as they are still in un-
explored condition, but the characteristics noted above will, 1t 19 hoped, suffice for
the present

G3 Coming to the Mainland of Gujarat, we take the North Gujarat or Pattant
first The dialect of the northern most part near Palanpur is saturated with Mar-
wan, but the Pattam or Ciivah or Gujarati proper (whuch 1s its old name) 1s also not
free from that influence iere also the vocalic group i11s contracted into ai as in
Kathawadi SMG bhi = NG bhar a +a nazal vowel or a nazal consonant = 5+the

nazal sound. thus SMG cido = NG cido, SMG mide =NG msde The SMG long

i=NG ¢ under the same circumstances SMG viti=NG vet, SMG nice=NG nese
The final nazahzation tends to disappear We have to note that it 1s strong in Ka-

thawar SMG keryii =NG koryu, SMG bari =NG bairi The SMG e, ch=NGs,

, incommon with Kathiawar. SMG iico =NG 3s9, SMG kharci = NG khars: (kath
kar§1) The gutteral kh-+a palatal vowel = palatal ch+the vowel SMG khetar =
NG chetar ,, so also SMG g = NG 1 SMG lagyo = NG layyo The tendency to replace ,
lby r SMG saghhi = NG saghri’, SMG agel = NG ager , SMG dholS = NG dhoro
In grammar, the inst joc form ends in -1, notin-easinSMG thus SMG hathe = NG

hathi The prons mi, ui are used forpmi, tomi SMG me, te, ame, teme, etc The
2nd pers sing pres "ends im -# and 1s different from the 3rd sing asmare 8 =SMG
mare che (‘thou beatest)’, in future the -é 1s sometimes replaced by -h- ufvoiced as
SMG marge =NG marhe This 1s due to Marwadi influence

50 THE LANGUAGE OF GUJARAT

64. The Charotart dralect has peculiar palatal sounds, the SMG c, ch,j and jh
being affricated to ts, tsh, dz, dzh, (wntten as c, ch, j, jh) ch 1s pronounced as 5
im the verb ‘to be’ Char vetsi=SMG v-eci , char-tshokro= SMG chokro; Char. dzarye
= SMG yoryo, SMG che = Char tse, SMG ch =Char tso The gutteral k and kh
followed by a palatal vowel become c and ch respectively , SMG ketla = char. cetla ,

SMG dikro= Char dicro, SMG nikhvét =Char né ch vi, SMG khetar = Char
chetar The OI s becomes h (unvoiced) SMG sird = Char hari, SMG simo=

Char hamo, SMG sisi = Char haha In gram the post-position thi 1s pronounced
as $1 khus: i= SMG khusithi ‘with Pleasure ’ In the verbs, the 2nd pers sg pres
1s modelled on the first person’ thus mari sil 1s Ist and 2nd pers sing In compound
verbs, the auxiliary che 1s often shortened to ch. as SMG mareche = Char mare ch
In future, the Ist and 2nd pers sing. show -e- before the sign § mare-6 This 1s 4
very old form. The use of prop-words like kane (ht 1s 1t not) 1s a feature of this dia-
lect

65 The Surts dialect In this dialect, the SMG $ and SMGs=Surtih SMG
das = Surti dah, SMG manas = Surti manah; SMG saro = Surti haro, SMG $d =
Surti hit, SMG Sak = Surti hak

The onigmal mitral hislost SMG hu =Surt: if, SMG hoto = Surt: ito, SMG
koh = Surti kai’ In the dropping of mtervocali -h- 1t resembles Kathiawani

A large scale confusion of cerebral and dental stops as well as nazals more in
favour of cerebrals 1s an outstanding charactenstic of this dialect SMG t=Sur +
SMG tome = Surti tome, SMG tahgi=Sur tang, SMG th=Sur th SMG thori=
Sur thoda , SMG ektht = Sur ekthi, SMG d=Sur d SMG dahéro= Sur dahado,
SMG dh=Sur dh SMG didhti=Sur didhti ~The SMG -n-=Surtin SMG ‘karan = =
Sur karan —SMG -1-=Sur -l- SMG gole = = Sur gale Confusion between n and 1
SMG n=Sur 1 SMGnakhe=Sur lakhe The tendency to double smgle consonants
for the sake of emphasis SMG nokar Sur nokkar —Melathesis of the group, cons
+y, yielding the group, y+the cons with a vowel ghde after y Thus SMG mary
= Sur. mayoro, SMG paryo=Sur payers, SMG cilyo=Sur cayalo, SMG ponyo or
poryo= Sur poyero —In the conjugation, the decay of the final vowel of the auxihary
verb che 1s more marked here than anywhere else Thus the aux chu, che, chie
become ch The forms becomes i maru ch, tu marech, te mare ch, hame mane ch,
tame maro ch, te mare ch —The future changes its § to h (unvoiced) regularly The
forms become marth, marhu, mathe, mairho The future 1s occasionally shown by
the intentional potential form, thus wu java or javano—The dhalect of eastern
Broach and Panchmahals show a large mixture of Bhih elements , otherwise they are
of Surti and Carotan forms respectively

A special characteristic of the Surti dialect 1s that 1t forms rts continuous present
very often from the pres part of the principal verb followed by the pres forms of
‘to be’ chi? This 1s quite different from the practice of Gujarati language, eg, hu
karto cha. Surtr SMG hu kerticht

The language of Baroda Caty and the sterrounding villages shows‘the mfluence of
Marathi 1n vocabulary, intonation and sentence construction But it does not de-
serve to be called a separate dialect on that score

G6. Special Dialects.

We shall now say a fow words in connection with the special dialects or the
dhalects used Dy classcsaf prople ‘The Gujarat Literary lancuace as seen in the works
of well-known maedem writers is a vanity which, asa fterary Janguage, should be
considered as a speci language, used bv a specral~-thouch highly educated—class
of people Ttas charactensed by aan tare of many diidects, new and old, highly
saturated with learned lowaewards from Sanskrit, Perstan and Arabic, and to a cer-
tain extent artificial (though artistic at the same time) Asa natural with literary
languages, 136 not meant fer duly intercourse Thais based on the standard form of
Gujarait

We nexticome to the hing race of the Parse Gujarat is the mother tongue of
this commits, but on account of long scareation and want of free mtercourse with
the other people of Gujarat. it has preserved some very old tras of OG | The past
participle, for example, im Parsi ends in -1y, winch was the casein the MOG of 17th and
1Sth centuris MVorcover, when the Paras came to Gujarat they had to adopt Guyarati
Janguage as the mother Congue Gujarat was, thaefore, superimposed on their
onegmal Persan Punguave Phas Persrin-as well as thar religous Avestic language
has no cerebrals ‘The influence of (he substratum language is still observed in their
mmaluhtv to pronounce caebrals, though they first learnt the old Surt: from
Gujarati Janenage which had a puruaht, for cerebral sounds ‘The Parsis even now
produce trac dentals m plaice of Giyarat cerebrals or Enuhsh alvcolars They also
show preference for r and } sounds to rand which as .se explicable on the same
theory thus SVG pary.s=Part parva, SMG igl=Par1 agal SMG pon=Parsi
pan, SMG dukkar=Parsi dukhar They preserve the OI s OG s and h, not changing
them to -h- (unvoiced) or ¢ respectively as the other Guy dialects do They have
some special pronunciation (forms tewan nom pl 3rd per, tem f), In conjugation
they follow the Surti way of omiting the last vowel of the austhary verb che, chu,
clue, ete , all of which are changed toch The ofthe future become snoth The
Parsis pronounce the nasals very distmetly, quite unlike their Hindu brethren
The conditional form hote, karte, etc , in stead of SMG hot, karat, ete , are common
in Parsi newspapcrs

67. The Dualects of the Mohanumadans +

Mohammadans are scattered all over Gujarat, but they are in large collections in
places hke Ahmedabad, Surat, Junagadh, etc on lustorical grounds Among them
there are different groups (a) The cultwators called Mommas live m villages and
till the sol ~=They are im large number mm Broach District and round about, and in |
Macchu Kantha in Kathiawar Their language 1s the same as the local language or
the language of the district mm which they stay They never speak Urdu or

time they get an opportunity of hearing their scripture explamed to them in Gujarati

Urdu lauguage (6) Of the merchant Mahomedans some reside m villages and carry
on home-industries like o1l-mulls, making tin vessels, and are called Ghanchis, Khojas
Dhobis, Barbers, ete They speak the language of their district They are scattered
all over the rural area of Gujrat But they visit therr religious places more
often and understand Urdu or Hindustam though they do not speak it in ther
homes In religion, Khoyas are different from others Of those who live in towns
and cities and who serve in the British Government or native States in Police and
Mbhtary, the class called Sapais form a majority They speak a form of broken Urdir
in the houses, but also broken Gujarati outside As a matter of fact, they are
neither masters of Gujarat: nor of Urdu Among them education 1s Jess and hence
they are unable to enjoy the high hterary beauties of Gujarati or of Urdu But the
nobler classes Saiyads, Kadns, etc , are highly educated and cultured people Their
children learn Urdu from childhood and in their homes they speak eloquent Urdu
or Hindustam language Their manners and customs are refined and resemble those
of the cultured classes of Upper India They also speak good Guyarati but their
Gujarati 1s mixed with Urdu words and often contaminated with Urdu grammatical

and idiomatic bias

Next we come to those Mohammadan communities who speak special Gujarati
dialects They are the Borahs and the AMemnons The Bohras were Brahmins who
embraced Islam under the influence of the Arabs Their centres are Siddhpur in
North Gujarat and Surat m the South They are also in Jarge number in Kathiawar.
The Bohras never spoke Urdu or Hindustani, they have always spoken Gujarati in
the past But bemg segregated from other Hmdus socially and in rehgion, their
social circle became too narrow and the language fossilized. Their preference for
x, land dental sounds often to the exclusion of r,1 and cerebrals, small voca-
bulary and limited idioms indicate the stereotyped nature of their language. There
1s no literature mm the Bohra dialect.

The Afemons speak a form of Kacchi highly nuxed with Gujarat: m their homes
and among themselves , with others they speak Gujarati with Kacchi accent This
community belongs to Kathiawar, although now they are found all over the world.
Their language is the same as that of the Hmdu Bhatias who also trace their origin
from Kucch. There is a close relation between the manners and customs of the
Bhatias and the Memons There is a theory which states that Memons are the
Bhatias converted to Islam In Kathiawar, they came from Cutch They have two
centres in Kathiawar, one in Halar near Balambha, Joria, etc , and another in central
Kathiawar at Jetpur, Dhoray: Some of them are very well-to-do people and spend
large sums of money in chamtties The language of Halai Memons 1s m a purer form
and shows less mixture of Gujarati idiom than that of the Memons of Central
Kathiawar. -

Sumilar to the dialect of the Memons but differmg from it in many respects is the
language of Mianas, a crmmal tmbe of Mala m Macchukantha The Mirayas came

70 Sir George has pncn Nagirpor th: Dialect of Naer Betiines, Bi til on
the Dialect of Anand Brahmuns, Patedars or the Ditlect of Patidar. of Ch irotar, ind
Gamadia of Ahmedabad district, as separate dhalects but they do not descrve to b>
considered as such It 1s true the Navars of Gujarat are a luehly cmahized and
cultured community and ther langnage was easily distinemsh ible from those of
other classes some 50 years ago when education was a previleged for the few, But
owing to the expansion of education and the consequent Jevelling out of the Dialects,
the language of the Nagirs has become indistingmshable im many respects from the
standard form of Gujarati However, there are some turns of speech and idiomatic
expressions, specially found in the language of Nagirs which pomt to their cultural
supenority in Gujarat Itissaid that the very Apabhramda, the N iigara Apabhraméa,
from which OG has directly come, was cultivated to perfection by the Nagars
On the same ground, we dispose of the Bhathah and the Patidan, the former shows

of. THE LANGUAGE OF GUJARAT

the peculiarities of Surt: and the latter of Carotar: The Gamdia of Ahmedabad 1s
not different from the speech of North Gujarat , but Ahmedabad being the southern-
most end of North Gujarat, and a cosmopolitan City, the language of villages round
about Ahmedabad presents some characteristics of a mixed language. We need not
count that speech as a special dialect, on that score

71 Sir George has also given Patanit:, the language of sik weavers of the
Deccan and Madras, Kakari the language of some Pathansm UP, the Punjab and
Hyderabad, and Tavimiki or Ghyadi, the language of wondermg tinkers of, Berar
and Maharastra, as forms of Gujarati language From the specimens adduced by
hum they appear to be such, but a deeper study and more material is necessary to
enable us to say something more about them

72. Dialects of the Borderland ‘

Finally, there are the dialects on the borderlands of Gujarat We know that
Gujarat has a sea border anda land-border On account of large commercial activity
m the ports of Gujarat begining from very early times down to our own age, the
language of ports was very much influenced imutially, as a result of which a more or
less unform language has come to be spoken m the principal ports of Gujarat, such
as Mandvi, Mundra, Okha, Salaya, Porbunder, Verawal, Diu, Gogo, Bhavnagar,
Cambay, Broach and Surat The sailor tribes of these towns are the citizens of the
world and their language 1s aiso of a more or Jess uniform nature On the land fron-
tier, Gujarati shows influence of the vanous neighbouring languages with which it
comes mn contact If the neighbouring language happens to be a closely related
language, both fuse imperceptibly into a new form of dialect If, on the other hand,
xt is not quite akin to Gujarati, their meetmg brings about a mechanical mixture
without any fusion Simdhi m the North and Marathi im the South are the only
languages which being totally of different stocks mix mechanically with Gujarat
In all other cases, Gujarati merges with cognate and closely related languages In
the north the mixture is represented by the language of Thar and Parkar dialects
reaching as far as and perhaps gomg a few mules beyond Mitthiin Smd = Tus dialect
shows a mixture of Smdtu, Cutchn, Marwari and Gujarati, words and phrases The
language near Damman im the South presents the same land of mrxture of Guyarati
and Marathi Comung to the area where as a result of fusmg new dialects have deve-
loped, we mention, starting from the north, a small borderland area between Palan-
pur, with Therad on onehand and Shiro, Danta and Jodhpur on the other. These
chalects present the characteristics of both m a state of fusion Next we come to
a large patch of Bhih languages hemmed m between the Gujarati language of
Mahikantha, Panch Mahals, and Rewakantha on the Gujarat side and the dialects of
East Marwar, Mewar and Malwa on the other. The Bhuili dialects are the result of the
fusion of Guy and the Rajastham languages The Bhils dialects are more akin to
Guj because the Guj influence 1s more predominating im the area than Rajastham.
Further south comes Khandeshi, which though a part of Malvi, separated from it
rather earher and now under the influence of Marathi has striking resemblance with
